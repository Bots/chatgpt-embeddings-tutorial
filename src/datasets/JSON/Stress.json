Of these two kinds of knowledge the latter, narrower, kind most often wins out, to our loss.  It is a pleasure and a privilege, therefore, to bring in front of the reader the ndings of modern science that rea rm the intuitions of age-old wisdom.  That was my primary goal in writing this book.","tokens":95},{"text":"My other purpose was to hold up a mirror to our stress- driven society so that we may recognize how, in myriad unconscious ways, we help generate the illnesses that plague us.  This is not a book of prescriptions, but I do hope it will serve its readers as a catalyst for personal transformation.  Prescriptions come from the outside, transformation occurs within.  There are many books of simple prescriptions of one sort or another—physical, emotional, spiritual—that appear each year.","tokens":91},{"text":"It was not my intention to write yet one more.  Prescriptions assume that something needs to be xed; transformation brings forth the healing—the coming to integrity, to wholeness—of what is already there.  While advice and prescriptions may be useful, even more valuable to us is insight into ourselves and the workings of our minds and bodies.  Insight, when inspired by the quest for truth, can promote transformation.","tokens":80},{"text":"For those seeking a healing message here, that message begins on page one with the very rst case study.  As the great physiologist Walter Cannon suggested, there is a wisdom in our bodies.  I hope When the Body Says No will help people align with the inner wisdom we all possess.  Some of the case examples in this book are derived from published biographies or autobiographies of well-known persons.","tokens":77},{"text":"The majority are taken from my clinical experience or from taped discussions with people who agreed to be interviewed and quoted regarding their medical and personal histories.

She had been my patient for eight M years, along with her husband and three children.  There was a shyness in her smile, a touch of self-deprecation.  She laughed easily.  When her ever-youthful face brightened, it was impossible not to respond in kind.","tokens":100},{"text":"My heart still warms —and constricts with sorrow—when I think of Mary.  Mary and I had never talked much until the illness that was to take her life gave its rst signals.  The beginning seemed innocent enough: a sewing-needle puncture wound on a ngertip failed over several months to heal.  The problem was traced to Raynaud’s phenomenon, in which the small arteries supplying the ngers are narrowed, depriving the tissues of oxygen.","tokens":95},{"text":"Gangrene can set in, and unfortunately this was the case for Mary.  Despite several hospitalizations and surgical procedures, she was within a year begging for an amputation to rid her of the throbbing ache in her nger.  By the time she got her wish the disease was rampant, and powerful narcotics were inadequate in the face of her constant pain.  Raynaud’s can occur independently or in the wake of other disorders.","tokens":85},{"text":"Smokers are at greater risk, and Mary had been a heavy smoker since her teenage years.  I hoped that if she quit, normal blood ow might return to her ngers.  After many relapses she nally succeeded.","tokens":42},{"text":"Unfortunately, the Raynaud’s proved to be the harbinger of something far worse: Mary was diagnosed with scleroderma, one of the autoimmune diseases, which include rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and many other conditions that are not always recognized to be autoimmune in origin, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and possibly even Alzheimer’s disease.","tokens":92},{"text":"Common to them all is an attack by one’s own immune system against the body, causing damage to joints, connective tissue or to almost any organ, whether it be the eyes, the nerves, the skin, the intestines, the liver or the brain.","tokens":54},{"text":"In scleroderma (from the Greek word meaning “hardened skin”), the immune system’s suicidal assault results in a sti ening of the skin, esophagus, heart and tissues in the lungs and elsewhere.  What creates this civil war inside the body? Medical textbooks take an exclusively biological view.  In a few isolated cases, toxins are mentioned as causative factors, but for the most part a genetic predisposition is assumed to be largely responsible.","tokens":95},{"text":"Medical practice re ects this narrowly physical mindset.  Neither the specialists nor I as her family doctor had ever thought to consider what in Mary’s particular experiences might also have contributed to her illness.  None of us expressed curiosity about her psychological state before the onset of the disease, or how this in uenced its course and nal outcome.","tokens":66},{"text":"We simply treated each of her physical symptoms as they presented themselves: medications for in ammation and pain, operations to remove gangrenous tissue and to improve blood supply, physiotherapy to restore mobility.  One day, almost on a whim, in response to a whisper of intuition that she needed to be heard, I invited Mary to make an hour-long appointment so that she would have the opportunity to tell me something about herself and her life.  When she began to talk, it was a revelation.","tokens":98},{"text":"Beneath her meek and di dent manner was a vast store of repressed emotion.  Mary had been abused as a child, abandoned and shuttled from one foster home to another.  She recalled huddling in the attic at the age of seven, cradling her younger sisters in her arms, while her drunken foster parents fought and yelled below.  “I was so scared all the time,” she said, “but as a seven-year-old I had to protect my sisters.","tokens":100},{"text":"And no one protected me. ” She had never revealed these traumas before, not even to her husband of twenty years.  She had learned not to express her feelings about anything to anyone, including herself.  To be self-expressive, vulnerable and questioning in her childhood would have put her at risk.  Her security lay in considering other people’s feelings, never her own.","tokens":74},{"text":"She was trapped in the role forced on her as a child, unaware that she herself had the right to be taken care of, to be listened to, to be thought worthy of attention.  Mary described herself as being incapable of saying no, compulsively taking responsibility for the needs of others.  Her major concern continued to be her husband and her nearly adult children, even as her illness became more grave.","tokens":77},{"text":"Was the scleroderma her body’s way of nally rejecting this all-encompassing dutifulness? Perhaps her body was doing what her mind could not: throwing o the relentless expectation that had been rst imposed on the child and now was self-imposed in the adult—placing others above herself.  I suggested as much when I wrote about Mary in my very rst article as medical columnist for The Globe and Mail in 1993.","tokens":92},{"text":"“When we have been prevented from learning how to say no,” I wrote, “our bodies may end up saying it for us. ” I cited some of the medical literature discussing the negative e ects of stress on the immune system.  The idea that people’s emotional coping style can be a factor in scleroderma or other chronic conditions is anathema to some physicians.","tokens":81},{"text":"A rheumatic diseases specialist at a major Canadian hospital submitted a scathing letter to the editor denouncing both my article and the newspaper for printing it.  I was inexperienced, she charged, and had done no research.  That a specialist would dismiss the link between body and mind was not astonishing.  Dualism—cleaving into two that which is one —colours all our beliefs on health and illness.  We attempt to understand the body in isolation from the mind.","tokens":86},{"text":"We want to describe human beings—healthy or otherwise—as though they function in isolation from the environment in which they develop, live, work, play, love and die.  These are the built-in, hidden biases of the medical orthodoxy that most physicians absorb during their training and carry into their practice.","tokens":59},{"text":"Unlike many other disciplines, medicine has yet to assimilate an important lesson of Einstein’s theory of relativity: that the position of an observer will in uence the phenomenon being observed and a ect the results of the observation.  The unexamined assumptions of the scientist both determine and limit what he or she will discover, as the pioneering Czech-Canadian stress researcher Hans Selye pointed out.","tokens":78},{"text":"“Most people do not fully realize to what extent the spirit of scienti c research and the lessons learned from it depend upon the personal viewpoints of the discoverers,” he wrote in The Stress of Life.  “In an age so largely dependent upon science and scientists, this fundamental point deserves special attention. ”1 In that honest and self-revealing assessment Selye, himself a physician, expressed a truth that even now, a quarter century later, few people grasp.","tokens":98},{"text":"The more specialized doctors become, the more they know about a body part or organ and the less they tend to understand the human being in whom that part or organ resides.  The people I interviewed for this book reported nearly unanimously that neither their specialists nor their family doctors had ever invited them to explore the personal, subjective content of their lives.  If anything, they felt that such a dialogue was discouraged in most of their contacts with the medical profession.","tokens":85},{"text":"In talking with my specialist colleagues about these very same patients, I found that even after many years of treating a person, a doctor could remain quite in the dark about the patient’s life and experience outside the narrow boundaries of illness.  In this volume I set out to write about the e ects of stress on health, particularly of the hidden stresses we all generate from our early programming, a pattern so deep and so subtle that it feels like a part of our real selves.","tokens":95},{"text":"Although I have presented as much of the available scienti c evidence as seemed reasonable in a work for the lay public, the heart of the book—for me, at least—is formed by the individual histories I have been able to share with the readers.  It so happens that those histories will also be seen as the least persuasive to those who regard such evidence as “anecdotal.","tokens":77},{"text":"” Only an intellectual Luddite would deny the enormous bene ts that have accrued to humankind from the scrupulous application of scienti c methods.  But not all essential information can be con rmed in the laboratory or by statistical analysis.  Not all aspects of illness can be reduced to facts veri ed by double-blind studies and by the strictest scienti c techniques.","tokens":73},{"text":"“Medicine tells us as much about the meaningful performance of healing, su ering and dying as chemical analysis tells us about the aesthetic value of pottery,” Ivan Ilyich wrote in Limits to Medicine.  We con ne ourselves to a narrow realm indeed if we exclude from accepted knowledge the contributions of human experience and insight.  We have lost something.","tokens":69},{"text":"In 1892 the Canadian William Osler, one of the greatest physicians of all time, suspected rheumatoid arthritis —a condition related to scleroderma—to be a stress-related disorder.  Today rheumatology all but ignores that wisdom, despite the supporting scienti c evidence accumulated in the 110 years since Osler rst published his text.  That is where the narrow scienti c approach has brought the practice of medicine.","tokens":87},{"text":"In elevating modern science to be the nal arbiter of our su erings, we have been too eager to discard the insights of previous ages.  As the American psychologist Ross Buck has pointed out, until the advent of modern medical technology and of scienti c pharmacology, physicians traditionally had to rely on “placebo” e ects.  They had to inspire in each patient a con dence in his, the patient’s, inner ability to heal.","tokens":94},{"text":"To be e ective, a doctor had to listen to the patient, to develop a relationship with him, and he had also to trust his own intuitions.  Those are the qualities doctors seem to have lost as we have come to rely almost exclusively on “objective” measures, technology-based diagnostic methods and “scienti c” cures.  Thus the rebuke from the rheumatologist was not a surprise.","tokens":85},{"text":"More of a jolt was another letter to the editor, a few days later—this time a supportive one—from Noel B.  Hersh eld, clinical professor of medicine at the University of Calgary: “The new discipline of psychoneuroimmunology has now matured to the point where there is compelling evidence, advanced by scientists from many elds, that an intimate relationship exists between the brain and the immune system….","tokens":85},{"text":"An individual’s emotional makeup, and the response to continued stress, may indeed be causative in the many diseases that medicine treats but whose [origin] is not yet known— diseases such as scleroderma, and the vast majority of rheumatic disorders, the in ammatory bowel disorders, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and legions of other conditions which are represented in each medical subspecialty…. ” The surprising revelation in this letter was the existence of a new eld of medicine.","tokens":100},{"text":"What is psychoneuroimmunology? As I learned, it is no less than the science of the interactions of mind and body, the indissoluble unity of emotions and physiology in human development and throughout life in health and illness.","tokens":48},{"text":"That dauntingly complicated word means simply that this discipline studies the ways that the psyche—the mind and its content of emotions—profoundly interacts with the body’s nervous system and how both of them, in turn, form an essential link with our immune defences.  Some have called this new eld psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology to indicate that the endocrine, or hormonal, apparatus is also a part of our system of whole-body response.","tokens":92},{"text":"Innovative research is uncovering just how these links function all the way down to the cellular level.  We are discovering the scienti c basis of what we have known before and have forgotten, to our great loss.  Many doctors over the centuries came to understand that emotions are deeply implicated in the causation of illness or in the restoration of health.  They did research, wrote books and challenged the reigning medical ideology, but repeatedly their ideas, explorations and insights vanished in a sort of medical Bermuda Triangle.","tokens":95},{"text":"The understanding of the mind-body connection achieved by previous generations of doctors and scientists disappeared without a trace, as if it had never seen daylight.  A 1985 editorial in the august New England Journal of Medicine could declare with magisterial self-assurance that “it is time to acknowledge that our belief in disease as a direct re ection of mental state is largely folklore. ”2 Such dismissals are no longer tenable.  Psychoneuroimmunology, the new science Dr.","tokens":97},{"text":"Hersh eld mentioned in his letter to the The Globe and Mail, has come into its own, even if its insights have yet to penetrate the world of medical practice.  A cursory visit to medical libraries or to online sites is enough to show the advancing tide of research papers, journal articles and textbooks discussing the new knowledge.  Information has ltered down to many people in popular books and magazines.","tokens":76},{"text":"The lay public, ahead of the professionals in many ways and less shackled to old orthodoxies, nds it less threatening to accept that we cannot be divided up so easily and that the whole wondrous human organism is more than simply the sum of its parts.  Our immune system does not exist in isolation from daily experience.  For example, the immune defences that normally function in healthy young people have been shown to be suppressed in medical students under the pressure of nal examinations.","tokens":92},{"text":"Of even greater implication for their future health and well-being, the loneliest students su ered the greatest negative impact on their immune systems.  Loneliness has been similarly associated with diminished immune activity in a group of psychiatric inpatients.  Even if no further research evidence existed—though there is plenty —one would have to consider the long-term e ects of chronic stress.","tokens":75},{"text":"The pressure of examinations is obvious and short term, but many people unwittingly spend their entire lives as if under the gaze of a powerful and judgmental examiner whom they must please at all costs.  Many of us live, if not alone, then in emotionally inadequate relationships that do not recognize or honour our deepest needs.  Isolation and stress a ect many who may believe their lives are quite satisfactory.  How may stress be transmuted into illness? Stress is a complicated cascade of physical and biochemical responses to powerful emotional stimuli.","tokens":98},{"text":"Physiologically, emotions are themselves electrical, chemical and hormonal discharges of the human nervous system.  Emotions in uence—and are in uenced by—the functioning of our major organs, the integrity of our immune defences and the workings of the many circulating biological substances that help govern the body’s physical states.  When emotions are repressed, as Mary had to do in her childhood search for security, this inhibition disarms the body’s defences against illness.","tokens":94},{"text":"Repression—dissociating emotions from awareness and relegating them to the unconscious realm—disorganizes and confuses our physiological defences so that in some people these defences go awry, becoming the destroyers of health rather than its protectors.  During the seven years I was medical coordinator of the Palliative Care Unit at Vancouver Hospital, I saw many patients with chronic illness whose emotional histories resembled Mary’s.","tokens":84},{"text":"Similar dynamics and ways of coping were present in the people who came to us for palliation with cancers or degenerative neurological processes like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known in North America as Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the great American baseball player who succumbed to it, and in Britain as motor neuron disease.","tokens":66},{"text":") In my private family practice, I observed these same patterns in people I treated for multiple sclerosis, in ammatory ailments of the bowel such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders, bromyalgia, migraine, skin disorders, endometriosis and many other conditions.  In important areas of their lives, almost none of my patients with serious disease had ever learned to say no.","tokens":88},{"text":"If some people’s personalities and circumstances appeared very di erent from Mary’s on the surface, the underlying emotional repression was an ever- present factor.  One of the terminally ill patients under my care was a middle- aged man, chief executive of a company that marketed shark cartilage as a treatment for cancer.  By the time he was admitted to our unit, his own recently diagnosed cancer had spread throughout his body.","tokens":85},{"text":"He continued to eat shark cartilage almost to the day of his death, but not because he any longer believed in its value.  It smelled foul—the o ensive stench was noticeable even some distance away—and I could only imagine what it tasted like.  “I hate it,” he told me, “but my business partner would be so disappointed if I stopped.","tokens":76},{"text":"” I convinced him that he had every right to live his last days without feeling responsible for someone else’s disappointment.  It is a sensitive matter to raise the possibility that the way people have been conditioned to live their lives may contribute to their illness.  The connections between behaviour and subsequent disease are obvious in the case of, say, smoking and lung cancer—except perhaps to tobacco-industry executives.","tokens":79},{"text":"But such links are harder to prove when it comes to emotions and the emergence of multiple sclerosis or cancer of the breast or arthritis.  In addition to being stricken with disease, the patient feels blamed for being the very person she is.  “Why are you writing this book?” said a fty-two- year-old university professor who has been treated for breast cancer.  In a voice edged with anger she told me, “I got cancer because of my genes, not because of anything I did.","tokens":100},{"text":"” “The view of sickness and death as a personal failure is a particularly unfortunate form of blaming the victim,” charged the 1985 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.  “At a time when patients are already burdened by disease, they should not be further burdened by having to accept responsibility for the outcome. ” We will return to this vexing question of assumed blame.  Here I will only remark that blame and failure are not the issue.  Such terms only cloud the picture.","tokens":98},{"text":"As we shall see, blaming the su erer— apart from being morally obtuse—is completely unfounded from a scienti c point of view.  The NEJM editorial confused blame and responsibility.  While all of us dread being blamed, we all would wish to be more responsible —that is, to have the ability to respond with awareness to the circumstances of our lives rather than just reacting.","tokens":76},{"text":"We want to be the authoritative person in our own lives: in charge, able to make the authentic decisions that a ect us.  There is no true responsibility without awareness.  One of the weaknesses of the Western medical approach is that we have made the physician the only authority, with the patient too often a mere recipient of the treatment or cure.  People are deprived of the opportunity to become truly responsible.  None of us are to be blamed if we succumb to illness and death.","tokens":89},{"text":"Any one of us might succumb at any time, but the more we can learn about ourselves, the less prone we are to become passive victims.  Mind and body links have to be seen not only for our understanding of illness but also for our understanding of health.  Dr.  Robert Maunder, on the psychiatric faculty of the University of Toronto, has written about the mind-body interface in disease.","tokens":75},{"text":"“Trying to identify and to answer the question of stress,” he said to me in an interview, “is more likely to lead to health than ignoring the question. ” In healing, every bit of information, every piece of the truth, may be crucial.  If a link exists between emotions and physiology, not to inform people of it will deprive them of a powerful tool.  And here we confront the inadequacy of language.","tokens":87},{"text":"Even to speak about links between mind and body is to imply that two discrete entities are somehow connected to each other.  Yet in life there is no such separation; there is no body that is not mind, no mind that is not body.  The word mindbody has been suggested to convey the real state of things.  Not even in the West is mind-body thinking completely new.","tokens":72},{"text":"In one of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates quotes a Thracian doctor’s criticism of his Greek colleagues: “This is the reason why the cure of so many diseases is unknown to the physicians of Hellas; they are ignorant of the whole.  For this is the great error of our day in the treatment of the human body, that physicians separate the mind from the body.","tokens":79},{"text":"”3 You cannot split mind from body, said Socrates— nearly two and a half millennia before the advent of psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology! Writing When the Body Says No has done more than simply con rm some of the insights I rst articulated in my article about Mary’s scleroderma.","tokens":66},{"text":"I have learned a great deal and have come to appreciate deeply the work of hundreds of physicians, scientists, psychologists and researchers who have charted the previously unmapped terrain of mind-body.  Work on this book has also been an inner exploration of the ways I have repressed my own emotions.  I was prompted to make this personal journey in response to a question from a counsellor at the British Columbia Cancer Agency, where I had gone to investigate the role of emotional repression in cancer.","tokens":95},{"text":"In many people with malignancy, there seemed to be an automatic denial of psychic or physical pain and of uncomfortable emotions like anger, sadness or rejection.  “Just what is your personal connection to the issue?” the counsellor asked me.  “What draws you to this particular topic?” The question brought to mind an incident from seven years ago.  One evening I arrived to see my seventy-six-year-old mother at the nursing home where she was a resident.","tokens":97},{"text":"She had progressive muscular dystrophy, an inherited muscle-wasting disease that runs in our family.  Unable to even sit up without assistance, she could no longer live at home.  Her three sons and their families visited her regularly until her death, which occurred just as I began to write this book.  I had a slight limp as I walked down the nursing home corridor.","tokens":71},{"text":"That morning I had undergone surgery for a torn cartilage in my knee, a consequence of ignoring what my body had been telling me in the language of pain that occurred each time I jogged on cement.  As I opened the door to my mother’s room, I automatically walked with a nonchalant, normal gait to her bed to greet her.  The impulse to hide the limp was not conscious, and the act was done before I was aware of it.","tokens":92},{"text":"Only later did I wonder what exactly had prompted such an unnecessary measure—unnecessary because my mother would have calmly accepted that her fty-one-year-old son would have a gimpy knee twelve hours post-surgery.  So what had happened? My automatic impulse to protect my mother from my pain, even in such an innocuous situation, was a deeply programmed re ex that had little to do with the present needs of either of us.","tokens":89},{"text":"That repression was a memory—a re- enactment of a dynamic that had been etched into my developing brain before I could possibly have been aware of it.  I am both a survivor and a child of the Nazi genocide, having lived most of my rst year in Budapest under Nazi occupation.  My maternal grandparents were killed in Auschwitz when I was ve months old; my aunt had also been deported and was unheard from; and my father was in a forced labour battalion in the service of the German and Hungarian armies.","tokens":99},{"text":"My mother and I barely survived our months in the Budapest ghetto.  For a few weeks she had to part from me as the only way of saving me from sure death by starvation or disease.  No great powers of imagination are required to understand that in her state of mind, and under the inhuman stresses she was facing daily, my mother was rarely up to the tender smiles and undivided attention a developing infant requires to imprint a sense of security and unconditional love in his mind.","tokens":92},{"text":"My mother, in fact, told me that on many days her despair was such that only the need to care for me motivated her to get up from bed.  I learned early that I had to work for attention, to burden my mother as little as possible and that my anxiety and pain were best suppressed.  In healthy mother-infant interactions, the mother is able to nourish without the infant’s having in any way to work for what he receives.","tokens":90},{"text":"My mother was unable to provide that unconditional nourishing for me—and since she was neither saintly nor perfect, quite likely she would not have completely succeeded in doing so, even without the horrors that beset our family.  It was under these circumstances that I became my mother’s protector—protecting her in the rst instance against awareness of my own pain.","tokens":73},{"text":"What began as the automatic defensive coping of the infant soon hardened into a xed personality pattern that, fty-one years later, still caused me to hide even my slightest physical discomfort in front of my mother.  I had not thought about the When the Body Says No project in those terms.  This was to be an intellectual quest, to explore an interesting theory that would help explain human health and illness.  It was a path others had trod before me, but there was always more to be discovered.","tokens":97},{"text":"The counsellor’s challenge made me confront the issue of emotional repression in my own life.  My hidden limp, I realized, was only one small example.  Thus, in writing this book, I describe not only what I have learned from others or from professional journals but also what I have observed in myself.  The dynamics of repression operate in all of us.","tokens":70},{"text":"We are all self-deniers and self-betrayers to one extent or another, most often in ways we are no more aware of than I was conscious of while “deciding” to disguise my limp.  When it comes to health or illness, it is only a matter of degree and, too, a matter of the presence or absence of other factors—such as heredity or environmental hazards, for example—that also predispose to disease.","tokens":93},{"text":"So in demonstrating that repression is a major cause of stress and a signi cant contributor to illness, I do not point ngers at others for “making themselves sick. ” My purpose in this book is to promote learning and healing, not to add to the quotient of blame and shame, both of which already exist in overabundance in our culture.  Perhaps I am overly sensitized to the issue of blame, but then most people are.","tokens":90},{"text":"Shame is the deepest of the “negative emotions,” a feeling we will do almost anything to avoid.  Unfortunately, our abiding fear of shame impairs our ability to see reality.  Despite the best e orts of many physicians, Mary died in Vancouver Hospital eight years after her diagnosis, succumbing to the complications of scleroderma.  To the end she retained her gentle smile, though her heart was weak and her breathing laboured.","tokens":86},{"text":"Every once in a while she would ask me to schedule long private visits, even in hospital during her nal days.  She just wanted to chat, about matters serious or trivial.  “You are the only one who ever listened to me,” she once said.

Had that been her fate, would she still be alive? 2 The Little Girl Too Good to Be True to say that the spring and summer of T WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT 1996 was a stressful time in Natalie’s life.","tokens":83},{"text":"In March her sixteen- I year-old son was discharged from a six-month stay at a drug rehabilitation facility.  He had used drugs and alcohol for the previous two years and was repeatedly expelled from school.  “We were lucky we got him into the residential treatment program,” says the fty-three-year-old former nurse.  “He had only been home a short while when rst my husband was diagnosed, and then me.","tokens":89},{"text":"” In July her husband, Bill, underwent surgery for a malignant bowel tumour.  After the operation they were told the cancer had spread to his liver.

Its symptoms depend on where the in ammation and scarring occur.","tokens":97},{"text":"The main areas attacked are usually the spinal cord, the brain stem and the optic nerve, which is the bundle of nerve bres carrying visual information to the brain.  If the site of damage is somewhere in the spinal cord, the symptoms will be numbness, pain or other unpleasant sensations in the limbs or trunk.  There may also be involuntary tightening of the muscles or weakness.

She strenuously objects to the suggestion that repression originating in her childhood experience has anything to do with the plaques of in ammation and scarring at the root of her MS symptoms.  Barbara’s multiple sclerosis presented eighteen years ago.  The rst symptoms erupted shortly after she invited a sociopathic man she had worked with at a correctional facility into her home for a two- week stay.","tokens":83},{"text":"“He had done a lot of therapy,” she says, “and the idea was to give him a fresh chance. ” Instead, the client caused havoc and disruption in her home and her marriage.

I thought it was ne, because it was a two- week deal.  But I would never do it again, obviously.","tokens":98},{"text":"I’m so good on boundaries now that I have one client who calls me the boundary queen—and she is another therapist, so we joke about it.  Unfortunately, I had to learn the hard way.  Sometimes I think that my MS was a punishment for my foolishness. ” This reference to disease as punishment raises a key issue, since people with chronic illness are frequently accused, or may accuse themselves, of somehow deserving their misfortune.","tokens":86},{"text":"If the repression/stress perspective truly did imply that disease was punishment, I would agree with Barbara’s rejection of it.  But a search for scienti c understanding is incompatible with moralizing and judgment.  To say that an ill-advised decision to invite a potentially harmful person into one’s home was a source of stress and played a role in the onset of illness is simply to point out a relationship between stress and disease.","tokens":86},{"text":"It is to discuss a possible consequence—not as punishment but as physiological reality.  Barbara insists she had nothing but a mutually loving and healthy relationship with her parents.  “My mother and I were great together.  We were always very close. ” “Boundaries are learned in our formative years,” I say.  “So why did you have to learn boundaries later, the hard way?” “I knew boundaries, but my mother did not.","tokens":91},{"text":"That’s what most of our ghts were about—about her inability to recognize where she ended and I began. ” Barbara’s introduction of an unstable and dangerous man into her home would be de ned in studies as a major stressor, but the chronic stress of poor boundaries that preceded it is not so easily identi ed.  The blurring of psychological boundaries during childhood becomes a signi cant source of future physiological stress in the adult.","tokens":91},{"text":"There are ongoing negative e ects on the body’s hormonal and immune systems, since people with indistinct personal boundaries live with stress; it is a permanent part of their daily experience to be encroached upon by others.  However, that is a reality they have learned to exclude from direct awareness.  “The cause, or causes, of multiple sclerosis remain unknown,” notes a respected textbook of internal medicine. 7 Most research refutes a contagious origin, although a virus may possibly be indicated.","tokens":98},{"text":"There are probably genetic in uences, since a few racial groups do seem to be free of it—for example, the Inuit in North America and the Bantus of southern Africa.

Rosner, former head of the UCLA Multiple Sclerosis Clinic.","tokens":92},{"text":"“And even people who have all the necessary genes do not necessarily get MS.

What could be the “environmental factors” alluded to by Dr.  Rosner? Dr.  Rosner’s otherwise excellent primer on multiple sclerosis summarily dismisses exploration of emotional stress as contributing factor to the onset.  Instead, he concludes that the disease is probably best explained by autoimmunity.","tokens":85},{"text":"“A person becomes allergic to his own tissue,” he explains, “and produces antibodies that attack healthy cells. ” He ignores the abundant medical literature linking autoimmune processes themselves to stress and personality, a vital link to be explored more fully in later chapters.

Orthodox medical opinion has shifted very little since then.  “Stress does not cause multiple sclerosis,” a pamphlet recently issued by the University of Toronto’s MS clinic advised patients, “although people with MS are well advised to avoid stress. ” The statement is misleading.","tokens":89},{"text":"Of course stress does not cause multiple sclerosis—no single factor does.  The emergence of MS no doubt depends on a number of interacting in uences.  But is it true to say that stress does not make a major contribution to the onset of this disease? Research studies and the lives of the persons we have looked at strongly suggest that it does.","tokens":66},{"text":"Such also is the evidence of the life Jacqueline du Pré, whose illness and death are a virtual textbook illustration of the devastating e ects of the stress brought on by emotional repression.  People often wept at du Pre’s concerts.  Her communication with audiences, someone remarked, “was quite breathtaking and left everyone spellbound. ” Her playing was passionate, sometimes unbearably intense.  She blazed a direct path to the emotions.","tokens":87},{"text":"Unlike her private persona, her stage presence was completely uninhibited: hair ying, body swaying, it was more typical of rock ‘n’ roll amboyance than of classical restraint.  “She appeared to be a sweet, demure milkmaid,” an observer recalled, “but with cello in hands she was like one possessed.","tokens":73},{"text":"”10 To this day some of du Pré’s recorded performances, notably of the Elgar cello concerto, are unsurpassed—and are likely to remain so.

Inexplicable? Perhaps not.","tokens":75},{"text":"Although she was unaware of it, by the time she was twenty, Jacqueline du Pré was also in the autumn of her life.  The illness that was soon to end her musical career was only a few years away.  Regret, loss and resignation had all been too abundantly a part of her unspoken emotional experience.  She understood Elgar because she had partaken of the same su ering.  His portrait always disturbed her.","tokens":82},{"text":"“He had a miserable life, Hil,” she told her sibling, “and he was ill, yet through it all he had a radiant soul, and that’s what I feel in his music. ” She was describing herself, from her earliest beginnings.  Jackie’s mother, Iris, su ered the death of her own father while she was still in the maternity hospital with Jackie.","tokens":83},{"text":"From then on, Jackie’s relationship with her mother became one of symbiotic dependence from which neither party could free herself.  The child was neither allowed to be a child nor permitted to grow up to be an adult.  Jackie was a sensitive child, quiet and shy, sometimes mischievous.  She was said to have been placid, except when playing the cello.  A music teacher recalls her at age six as having been “terribly polite and nicely brought up.","tokens":92},{"text":"” She presented a pleasant and compliant face to the world.  The secretary at the girls’ school Jackie attended remembers her as a happy and cheerful child.  A high-school classmate recalls her as a “friendly, jolly girl who tted in well. ” Jackie’s inner reality was quite di erent.  Hilary recounts that her sister burst into tears one day: “No one likes me at school.  It’s horrible.  They all tease me.","tokens":93},{"text":"” In an interview Jacqueline portrayed herself as “one of those children other children can’t stand.  They used to form gangs and chant horrid things. ” She was an awkward youngster, socially gauche, with no academic interests and little to say.  According to her sister, Jackie always had di culty expressing herself in words.","tokens":68},{"text":"“Observant friends noted an incipient strain of melancholy underneath Jackie’s sunny exterior,” writes her biographer, Elizabeth Wilson, in Jacqueline du Pré. 12 All her life, until her illness, Jackie would hide her feelings from her mother.","tokens":54},{"text":"Hilary recalls a chilling childhood memory of Jacqueline’s intense expression and secretive whisper, “Hil, don’t tell Mum but … when I grow up, I won’t be able to walk or move. ” How are we to understand that horri c self-prophecy? Either as something uncanny or as the projection of exactly how, in her unconscious depths, the child Jackie already felt: incapable of moving independently, fettered, her vital self paralyzed.","tokens":100},{"text":"And “don’t tell Mum”? The resignation of someone already aware of the futility of trying to convey her pain, fear and anxiety—her shadow side—to a parent unable to receive such communication.  Much later, when multiple sclerosis struck, all Jackie’s lifelong resentment toward her mother erupted in bursts of uncontrolled, profane rage.  The docile child became a profoundly hostile adult.","tokens":81},{"text":"As much as Jacqueline du Pré loved and craved the cello, something in her resisted the role of cello virtuoso.  This virtuoso persona pre-empted her true self.  It also became her only mode of emotional communication and her only way of keeping her mother’s attention.  Multiple sclerosis was to be her means of casting o this role—her body’s way of saying no.  Jacqueline herself was incapable of refusing the world’s expectations directly.","tokens":97},{"text":"At the age of eighteen, already in the public eye, she was wistfully envious of another young cellist who was then experiencing a crisis.  “That girl is lucky,” she told a friend.  “She could give up music if she wanted to.  But I could never give it up because too many people have spent too much money on me. ” The cello enabled her to soar to unimaginable heights and it shackled her.","tokens":89},{"text":"Terri ed as she was of the toll a musical career would take on her, she succumbed to the impositions of her talent and her family’s needs.  Hilary speaks of Jackie’s “cello voice. ” Because Jackie’s direct means of emotional expression had been sti ed early on, the cello became her voice.  She poured all her intensity, pain, resignation— all her rage—into her music.","tokens":90},{"text":"As one of her cello teachers astutely observed when Jackie was an adolescent, she was forcing the instrument to express her internal aggression through her playing.  When engaged in music, she was fully animated by emotions that were diluted or absent everywhere else in her life.  This is why she was so was riveting to watch and so often painful to listen to —“almost scary” in the words of the Russian cellist Misha Maisky.","tokens":88},{"text":"Twenty years after her childhood debut, now ill with MS, Jackie told a friend what she had felt on rst nding herself on stage.  “It was as if until that moment she had in front of her a brick wall which blocked her communication with the outside world.  But the moment Jackie started to play for an audience, that brick wall vanished and she felt able to speak at last.  It was a sensation that never left her when she performed.","tokens":88},{"text":"” As an adult she was to write in her diary that she had never known how to speak in words, only through music.  Her relationship with her husband, Daniel Barenboim, dominated the last phase of Jacqueline du Pré’s life before multiple sclerosis ended her cello playing.  A charming, cultured and cosmopolitan Argentine Jew who had grown up in Israel, Barenboim by his early twenties was a supernova in the international musical galaxy.","tokens":93},{"text":"He was a sought-after concert pianist and chamber musician and was also making a name for himself as a conductor.  When du Pré and Barenboim met, the musical communication between them was spontaneously electric, passionate, even mystical.  A love a air and marriage were inevitable.  It seemed a fairy-tale romance; they became the glamour couple of the classical music world.  Unfortunately, Jackie could no more be her true self in her marriage than in her family of origin.","tokens":93},{"text":"People who knew her well soon noticed that she spoke with a curious, “inde nable” mid- Atlantic accent.  This unconscious adoption of her husband’s mode of speaking signalled the merging of her identity with that of another, more dominant personality.  Hilary writes that once more Jackie was tting herself to someone else’s needs and expectations: “The wide- open spaces of her personality had little chance for expression except through their music-making.","tokens":95},{"text":"She had to be the Jackie the circumstances demanded. ” When her yet-undiagnosed progressive neurological disease began to cause serious symptoms like weakness and falling, she followed a lifelong pattern of silence.  Rather than alarm her husband, she hid her problems, pretending that other causes had slowed her down.","tokens":58},{"text":"“Well, I can only say that it doesn’t feel like stress,” Jackie said one time, early in her marriage, when Hilary asked how she coped with the strain of both a personal and professional relationship with her husband.  “I nd myself a very happy person.  I love my music and I love my husband and there seems to be ample time for both. ” A short while later she ed husband and career.","tokens":90},{"text":"She came to believe that her husband stood between her and her true self.  She brie y left the marriage, acting out her unhappiness through a sexual a air with her brother-in-law—a further example of her uncertain boundaries.  Deeply depressed, for a while she wanted nothing to do with the cello.  Soon after she returned to both marriage and music, she was diagnosed with MS.  Jacqueline du Pré’s cello voice remained her only voice.","tokens":93},{"text":"Hilary called it her sister’s salvation.  It was not.  It worked for audiences, but it did not work for her.  People loved her impassioned music making, but no one who mattered ever truly listened.  Audiences wept and critics sang her praises, but no one heard her.  Tragically, she, too, was deaf to her true self.  Artistic expression by itself is only a form of acting out emotions, not a way of working them through.","tokens":91},{"text":"After her sister’s death, Hilary listened to a 1973 BBC tape of the Elgar concerto, with Zubin Mehta conducting.  It had been Jackie’s nal public performance in Britain.  “A few moments of tuning, a short pause, and she began.  I suddenly jumped.  She was slowing the tempo down.  A few more bars and it became vividly clear.  I knew exactly what was happening.  Jackie, as always, was speaking through her cello.","tokens":93},{"text":"I could hear what she was saying….

Internally generated stresses take their toll without in any way seeming out of the ordinary.","tokens":83},{"text":"For those habituated to high levels of internal stress since early childhood, it is the absence of stress that creates unease, evoking boredom and a sense of meaninglessness.

On the other hand, it is possible to feel tension without activating the physiological mechanisms of stress.

To facilitate ght or escape, blood needs to be diverted from the internal organs to the muscles, and the heart needs to pump faster.

Chronic stress is activation of the stress mechanisms over long periods of time when a person is exposed to stressors that cannot be escaped either because she does not recognize them or because she has no control over them.

Chronic disruption results in ill health.","tokens":73},{"text":"In each of the individual histories of illness in this book, one or more aspect of emotional competence was signi cantly compromised, usually in ways entirely unknown to the person involved.

In the end not even a Supreme Court decision could deny her that right.  Her story is congruent with what the lives of these others also teach us.  The life histories of people with ALS invariably tell of emotional deprivation or loss in childhood.  Characterizing the personalities of ALS patients are relentless self-drive, reluctance to acknowledge the need for help and the denial of pain whether physical or emotional.","tokens":100},{"text":"All these behaviours and psychological coping mechanisms far predate the onset of illness.  The conspicuous niceness of most, but not all, persons with ALS is an expression of a self-imposed image that needs to conform to the individual’s (and the world’s) expectations.  Unlike someone whose human characteristics emerge spontaneously, the individual seems trapped in a role, even when the role causes further harm.","tokens":79},{"text":"It is adopted where a strong sense of self should be—a strong sense of self that could not develop under early childhood conditions of emotional barrenness.  In people with a weak sense of self, there is often an unhealthy fusion with others.  The example of New York Yankees rst baseman Lou Gehrig is instructive.  Gehrig earned the sobriquet “the iron horse” for his implacable refusal to remove himself from the lineup regardless of illness or injury.","tokens":92},{"text":"In the 1930s, long before the days of sophisticated physiotherapy and sports medicine, he set a record for consecutive games played—2,130—that would stand for the next six decades.

I ran the business, made the house, as well as decorating.  It was practically a year to the day we moved in that I discovered the lump. ” The ALS diagnosis followed a few months later.","tokens":96},{"text":"Laura exempli es just how impossible people with ALS nd it to let go of self-imposed responsibilities long after their bodies have signalled rebellion.

For the child it is no relief to feel sadness or anger if no one is there to receive those emotions and to provide some comfort and containment.  Everything had to be held in rigidly.","tokens":97},{"text":"The physical rigidity of ALS may well be a consequence.  There is perhaps only so much energy the nervous system can expend pushing down powerful emotions that cry out for expression.  At some point in particularly susceptible individuals, it seems reasonable to suppose, nerves may lose the ability to renew themselves.","tokens":54},{"text":"Could ALS be a result of an exhausted nervous system no longer being capable of replenishing itself? “Why has the fact that ALS patients, as a group, are strikingly congenial not been discussed in the literature?” asked the Cleveland neurologists in their Munich presentation.  “Probably the principal reason is that it is based on subjective assessments, which lack a means of scienti c veri cation.","tokens":82},{"text":"Thus, according to our psychiatric colleagues, ‘niceness’ is extremely di cult to quantify. ” Perhaps if researchers took greater care to obtain patients’ life histories, much useful information now being missed would be forthcoming.

It was very di cult to nd your own identity with my mother.","tokens":82},{"text":"When I consider my brother’s illness, I think we all did our work to gure out how to become separate individuals.

Proud of her innate ability to move freely and creatively, Joanne experienced this diagnosis as the most devastating blow imaginable.","tokens":98},{"text":"“I’d rather die of some horrible cancer,” she said.  Already at the end stages of the disease, she wanted me to promise to kill her when the time came.  I guaranteed we would not let her su er pain or breathlessness.

You can come to know people quickly and deeply when you look after them during their time of dying.","tokens":100},{"text":"Joanne and I had many talks.  “All my life,” she once told me, “ever since childhood, I have been having this dream of being buried alive.

There on the wall was a poster that read ‘Having ALS Is Like Being Buried Alive.","tokens":88},{"text":"’” I do not believe Joanne’s recurrent nightmare was either coincidence or preternatural premonition.  The image of being alone, con ned, desperate and doomed, unheard by anyone, was the psychological truth of her childhood existence.

I could only speculate what stresses over how many generations had nally created that situation for her in her family of origin.","tokens":92},{"text":"As it was, neither her parents nor her brothers and sisters visited during her terminal phase.  A new family of devoted caregivers accompanied Joanne during her nal weeks on earth and were with her to her dying breath.  She was deeply asleep during her nal days.  The promise was kept: she did not su er at the last.  Sue Rodriguez, the Victoria woman whose court-defying suicide was carried out in the presence of a member of Canada’s Parliament, was also emotionally isolated from her family.","tokens":98},{"text":"Her biographer, the journalist Lisa Hobbs-Birnie, describes the day Rodriguez’s diagnosis with ALS was con rmed: Sue felt her knees buckle, her legs turn to water.  She knew what ALS was, had seen the documentary on the physicist-astronomer Stephen Hawking, knew his condition, tried to imagine her own life inside a body that couldn’t sit up, walk, talk, laugh, write or hug her child….  She leaned against a wall.","tokens":97},{"text":"She became aware of a terrible sound, as primal as the cry of a wounded animal, unlike anything she’d heard before.  She realized only slowly, from the horri ed expressions of passersby, that it was coming from her own mouth….  She phoned to tell her mother and stepfather, Doe and Ken Thatcher.  Doe said: “Ken and I thought it might be that. ” Sue felt abandoned, and gave way to uncontrollable grief.","tokens":91},{"text":"9 Sue was the second of the ve children born to her parents within ten years.  She was always the outsider.  Her mother somehow believed that Sue made this choice: “It almost seemed,” she said, “from the moment she was born she didn’t feel part of the family in the same way as the others did.  The illness only made it worse. ” Mother and daughter had only occasional telephone contact during the nal months of Sue’s life.","tokens":95},{"text":"Doe was characterized by her daughter and others as “not the caregiving type. ” “The mother’s brusque reaction when Sue called from the hospital with her diagnosis,” writes Hobbs-Birnie, “was typical not only of Doe’s lack of caregiving skill, but of the kind of interaction mother and daughter had.  Things did not improve as Sue’s disease progressed.","tokens":86},{"text":"” Emotional communication was foreign to the Rodriguez family, according to her brother, fourteen months her junior.  He was the only sibling to maintain any regular contact with his dying sister.  Most of the family, he said, preferred not to show their feelings.  This is not some bizarre, unfeeling group of human beings here.  The problem was not a lack of feeling but an excess of painful, unmetabolized emotion.  The Rodriguez family dealt with emotional hurt by repressing it.","tokens":93},{"text":"Generations of family history had brought them to that coping pattern.  Sue’s father, Tom, dead of alcohol- induced cirrhosis of the liver at age forty- ve, had been an earlier victim of this surfeit of pain.  He was a man of low self-esteem, all his life dominated by others.","tokens":64},{"text":"What drove a terminally ill Sue Rodriguez, the mother of a young child, to expend her diminishing physical and psychic resources on highly public court battles and media campaigns that taxed her vital energies to the limit? An articulate woman with an engaging personality and a beautiful smile, she became a hero to many who saw her as a crusader of indomitable courage and spirit.  She was popularly viewed as someone ghting for her right to die at a time and in the manner of her own choosing.","tokens":98},{"text":"There was always more to the Sue Rodriquez story than the simple issue of autonomy in death, though this was the part of her drama that caught the imagination of the public.  Behind the popular facade of a con dent and determined ghter, Ms.  Rodriguez was a frightened and lonely person with a very fragile support system, alienated from her estranged husband and from her family.  It was a multi-layered scenario.  As usual, the most public layer was also the most super cial one.","tokens":95},{"text":"The biographer believes Sue Rodriguez was “a woman of strong convictions and a powerful sense of self.  She had control over her life and preferred to have control over her death. ” As with all ALS patients, the reality was rather more contradictory.  Strong convictions do not necessarily signal a powerful sense of self: very often quite the opposite.","tokens":65},{"text":"Intensely held beliefs may be no more than a person’s unconscious e ort to build a sense of self to ll what, underneath, is experienced as a vacuum.  Her history of deeply troubled personal relationships indicates that Sue Rodriguez had never been in control of her life.  She had lled roles without ever being close to her real self.  Her anguished question to the court and the public—“Who owns my life?”—was a summation of her whole existence.","tokens":98},{"text":"Her ght for control in death turned out to be her nal and greatest role.  By the time her legal case opened, writes Lisa Hobbs-Birnie, “Sue Rodriguez was fast becoming a national gure.  She slid into the role as if her entire life had been a preparation for it, which indeed it had.","tokens":66},{"text":"” When Sue Rodriguez was diagnosed with ALS, in her rst despair she compared the impossibility of her situation with what she perceived were the relative advantages of fellow ALS su erer Stephen Hawking.  Writes Hobbs-Birnie, “She was given pamphlets on palliative care, and these pamphlets described patients who were ‘surrounded by loving family’ or who found joy in ‘living a life of the mind. ’ What loving family? she thought.","tokens":97},{"text":"What life of the mind? Let a genius like Stephen Hawking live a life of the mind.  But me, if I cannot move my own body, I have no life. ” If Stephen Hawking’s public status as a latter-day Einstein may be questioned by science cognoscenti, no one disputes his brilliance, originality of thought or intellectual fearlessness.","tokens":73},{"text":"There is universal admiration for the indomitable will that has sustained his life and work since a slight speech impediment signalled the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when he was only twenty years old.  Diagnosed in 1963, Hawking was given the medical prognosis that he had, at most, two years to live.  He has been near death on at least one occasion, ill with pneumonia and in a coma on a trip to Switzerland.","tokens":86},{"text":"Yet four decades after his diagnosis, paralyzed, wheelchair bound and completely dependent physically, he has, nonetheless, just published his second best-selling book.  He has travelled ceaselessly around the world, a lecturer in great demand despite his inability to utter a word in his own voice.  He has been the recipient of many scienti c honours.  Although there are exceptions, the course of ALS is generally predictable.  The vast majority of patients die within ten years of diagnosis, many much sooner.","tokens":95},{"text":"Very rarely people do make recovery from what seems like ALS, but it is extremely unusual for a person to live with its ravages for as long as Stephen Hawking has, continuing not only to work but to function at a high level.  What has enabled him to confound medical opinion and those grim statistics? We cannot understand Hawking’s course as an isolated clinical phenomenon, separated from the circumstances of his life and relationships.","tokens":83},{"text":"His longevity is, without doubt, a tribute to his spirited determination not to allow the disease to defeat him.  But I also believe that Sue Rodriguez’s bitter comparison was correct: the young Stephen had access to invisible resources denied to most people with ALS.  Given the nature of ALS as a disease that destroys body while leaving the intellect intact, an abstract thinker was in an ideal position to “live a life of the mind.","tokens":84},{"text":"” Unlike the athletic rock climber and former marathoner Rodriguez and unlike the dancers Laura and Joanne, Hawking did not see his body’s deterioration as impairing the role that he chose for himself.  On the contrary, it may have enhanced it.  Prior to his diagnosis and its attendant debility, he had been somewhat aimless, his shining intellectual gifts notwithstanding.  Hawking had always possessed tremendous cognitive and mathematical capacities and con dence, but he never seemed to feel comfortable in his body.","tokens":97},{"text":"“He was eccentric and awkward, skinny and puny,” write Michael White and John Gribbin in Stephen Hawking, A Life in Science.  “His school uniform always looked a mess and, according to his friends, he jabbered rather than talked clearly….  He was just that sort of kid—a gure of classroom fun, teased and occasionally bullied, secretly respected by some and avoided by most.","tokens":84},{"text":"” He did not look to ful ll the expectations those who had glimpsed his true abilities held for him.  The young Stephen, it appears, was the chosen bearer of the frustrated ambitions of his father who was evidently determined that his son would succeed at educational and social goals he, the father, had never quite attained.  One goal was to have Stephen attend one of England’s most prestigious private schools.","tokens":80},{"text":"The ten-year-old-boy was entered for the Westminster School scholarship examination: “The day of the examination arrived, and Stephen fell ill.  He never sat the entrance paper and consequently never obtained a place at one of England’s best schools. ” One may assume, of course, that this untimely illness was purely coincidental.  We may also see it as the child’s only way of saying no to parental pressure.","tokens":89},{"text":"Given the Hawking family’s penchant for privacy, the facts would be di cult to discern.  What we do know is that later on, with the young Hawking no longer living at home and at liberty to follow his preferences, these appeared to be more of a social than academic nature.  Stephen engaged in a fair bit of indolence and alcohol consumption, with avoidance of classes or studying—those classic forms of passive resistance in college.","tokens":85},{"text":"For a while his academic career looked in jeopardy, and brie y he considered entering the civil service.  It was only after his diagnosis that he began to focus his phenomenal intelligence on his work: elucidating the nature of the cosmos, bridging the theoretical gaps between Einsteinian relativity theory and quantum mechanics.  With his physical disability, he was freed from many of the tasks of teaching and administration other scientists have to shoulder.","tokens":82},{"text":"His biographers write: “Some have attributed his great successes in cosmology to this enhanced cerebral freedom, yet others have claimed that the turning-point in the application of his abilities was the onset of his condition, and that before then he was no more than an averagely bright student.","tokens":58},{"text":"” That latter point is di cult to accept, but even Hawking has acknowledged that it was only after the onset of his illness that he began to exert himself at anything: “I … started working for the rst time in my life.  To my surprise, I found I liked it.  Maybe it’s not really fair to call it work.  Someone once said, scientists and prostitutes get paid for doing what they enjoy.","tokens":84},{"text":"” Not much insight there about prostitutes, but it is clear Hawking has been in the extremely fortunate position of being able to pursue a genuine vocation, despite his extreme physical limitations.  The other indispensable factor Hawking possessed and Rodriquez missed was the unconditional emotional support and practical caring of a loved one.  For Stephen the source of this nurturing was his wife, now his former wife, Jane Hawking.","tokens":77},{"text":"In essence, she decided to devote her life to him—at great personal cost to herself, as she would come to learn.  The two met just before Stephen’s diagnosis with ALS and were married shortly afterwards.  Due to her own history, Jane was primed to accept the role of devoted and sel ess caregiver.","tokens":63},{"text":"I write sel ess here advisedly: there was lacking in her a developed, autonomous sense of self, and thus she completely identi ed with her role as Stephen’s nurse, mother and guardian angel.  “I wanted to nd some purpose to my existence,” she recalls in her 1993 memoir, Music to Move the Stars, “and I supposed I found it in the idea of looking after him.","tokens":86},{"text":"” When she doubted her ability to ful ll that daunting task, friends told her, “If he needs you, you must do it. ” She took it on.  The two young people did not just join each other as equals in a spousal partnership: they fused.  They became one body, heart and soul.  Without the subordination of Jane’s life and independent strivings to his, Stephen likely would not have survived, let alone succeeded to such a spectacular degree.","tokens":97},{"text":"His biographers assert that “without the help that Jane gave him, he almost certainly would not have been able to carry on, or had the will to do so. ”10 The relationship worked as long as Jane accepted her self- abnegating position and the one-way ow of psychic energy between them, from wife to husband.  The couple loved each other, but she would come to feel used.","tokens":81},{"text":"She recounts a strange incident when, in 1965, she arrived at her ance’s apartment with a broken arm in a cast: “He was actually expecting that I would put my secretarial skills to good use by typing out a job application for him.  The look of horri ed dismay that spread across his face as I walked into his room with my left arm bulging beneath my coat in a white plaster cast dashed all my hopes of even the merest display of sympathy.","tokens":97},{"text":"” The episode encapsulated the nature of their relationship: she was the ever-available, unspeaking and compliant mother/nanny gure whose services are expected, taken for granted and noticed only in their absence.  She travelled the world with her husband, daily confronting and overcoming myriad di culties that were only much later—and even then only partially—eased once he became an internationally famous and high-earning author.  She felt herself gradually disappear as an individual.","tokens":93},{"text":"She was sucked dry, sensing herself becoming a “brittle, empty shell, alone and vulnerable,” and nearly suicidal.  Hawking, for his part, reacted to her strivings for independence with disdain and nally with the rage of a child deserted by his mother.  The wife was eventually supplanted by a nurse who left her own husband to marry the scientist.

In September 2001 seventy-three-year-old Betty was incarcerated four and a half months for criminal contempt of court, following another logging protest.","tokens":92},{"text":"Although Clayoquot is mostly about Betty’s experiences as an environmental crusader, she also gives a vivid and honest history of her personal life.  With four husbands and eight children, she’s had an eventful life.  Now Betty acts as surrogate mother to Barbara Ellen’s son, Julian, who was only two when his mother passed away.  Barbara Ellen gave vent to frequent expressions of deep anger at her mother in the nal six months before she died.","tokens":93},{"text":"It is that anger Betty was still struggling to understand.  Betty Krawczyk was born in southern Lousiana, which, at that time, she says, was “mostly one big swamp. ” “I wasn’t raised to be a protestor,” she writes in Clayoquot.  “I was raised a poor, country, southern white woman. ” Memory is so selective, so subjective.","tokens":85},{"text":"At a sibling confab several years ago we were tickled and somewhat amazed to learn that we each, my brother and sister and I, had felt the others to be favored in the family.

We were there to be seen not heard, and seen as little as possible.  My mother was di erent.  She was warm and loving.","tokens":91},{"text":"Although I always knew she favored my brother and sister, she was so full of love some of it slopped over on me, too.

He couldn’t seem to stop after we got married.","tokens":96},{"text":"He nally collected one too many. ” Three more marriages and ve more children followed in the next two decades.  Barbara Ellen was the seventh among them, born just before Betty moved to Canada in 1966, “six kids in tow,” and her third marriage on the verge of breaking up.  They lived in Kirkland Lake, Ontario.  Her husband, a college instructor, was an emotionally distant workaholic who also drank.","tokens":84},{"text":"“I didn’t like John when he drank,” she writes.  “He had a tendency to get impossibly self- righteous and accusatory.

I thought that rst winter in Kirkland Lake would never end and that spring would never come.  Actually, spring never did come….","tokens":93},{"text":"I think the two most frustrated people in that non-existent spring were me and the baby, Barbara Ellen. ” Betty found a way out of her relationship with her husband by falling in love with his department head at the college and relocating with him to British Columbia.  It was mostly here that Barbara Ellen grew up, although there were moves back and forth between Eastern and Western Canada, and between the United States and Canada.","tokens":83},{"text":"Betty’s fourth marriage also failed, but over the years she found a truer sense of herself as a person, as a woman and as an activist.  Barbara Ellen was a sensitive child with health problems.  At the age of four, she began to have vomiting spells that nobody seemed able to diagnose.  These bouts recurred intermittently over the years, and Betty feels now they were related to stresses in her daughter’s life.","tokens":85},{"text":"As a young adult, Barbara became addicted to narcotic painkillers and tranquilizers that she would inject into her body.  Right up to the time of her diagnosis with breast cancer, she was ghting her addiction to drugs.  With no experience of stability, she was unable to establish an intimate, ongoing relationship with a man: she went from one relationship to another.  Julian was born when Barbara Ellen was twenty- ve, but when she married shortly afterwards, it was not to her child’s father.","tokens":98},{"text":"“That marriage didn’t last long,” says Betty.  “Martin was not able to cope with being married and having a little stepson. ” Barbara was highly intelligent, sensitive and creative.

She was taking care of Julian and doing some teaching of dance classes in Vancouver when she discovered her cancer.  “She told me she had had this mammogram, and they just wanted to do a mastectomy.","tokens":96},{"text":"She wasn’t willing to accept that.  Barbara had a keen intellect.  She researched all the material on the kind of cancer she had and investigated the treatment outcomes among her age group in the U. S.  and Canada.

Immediately, I wanted to do something.","tokens":94},{"text":"I tried to pressure her to look at some other options, and then she was just very, very angry and adamant and yelled at me—she’d never yelled at me before.  She was angry with me the whole last, I would say, six months of her life.","tokens":55},{"text":"Before, she wouldn’t stay mad; when she was angry with me, she would just say, ‘Okay, Mom, you want to think that, you think that,’ and she’d slam her door or something, but that would be it. ” “That’s not exactly an expression of anger—mostly of defeat and frustration. ” “She was always hurt by me for some reason, and I don’t know why.","tokens":98},{"text":"I think I was a terrible parent for this child.  My personality was hurtful to her. ” “You’re full of tears here.  Are you still feeling guilt about it?” “Maybe not so much guilt as a feeling that why couldn’t they have given her to someone else who could have dealt with her.  She was an extraordinary child in her sensitivity to the world, her understanding of the world, in her gentleness with the world.","tokens":93},{"text":"” “Gentleness … what was she like as a child?” “She was very precocious.  Wherever I took her, people were impressed with her demeanour and level of—I don’t want to say that she acted adult—but at her level of comprehension of the adult world. ” “How about emotionally?” “Emotionally? She was a very loving and a ectionate child.","tokens":93},{"text":"She was quite gentle and was always very loved by everyone, was always the teacher’s pet.  Other kids didn’t seem to resent it, though. ” “Do you have any sense at all that anybody ever tried to abuse her?” “There was one incident.  We had been to Louisiana visiting my mother and sister.  My sister had these four boys.  One boy was a year older than Barbara and bigger.  Barbara would have been about twelve.  She didn’t tell me about this.","tokens":100},{"text":"It wasn’t until we got back to California that she told Margaret, her sister.  Margaret came and told me that this cousin tried to get on top of Barbara.  They were the only two at home.  Barbara was very angry about it.  I remember asking Margaret, ‘Why didn’t she come tell me?’ and she said, ‘She thought because Doris is your sister that it would cause a big ruckus between you two.","tokens":91},{"text":"’” Betty and I then talked about Barbara’s illness and death.  At the time Barbara was diagnosed with cancer, Betty was running in a provincial election for the Green Party.  She resigned her candidacy to spend time with her ailing daughter.  I asked if she had found that di cult.  “It wasn’t that hard.  My feeling was that we needed each other.  But there was something in my personality that Barbara always found irritating.","tokens":87},{"text":"My voice was too loud for her, my actions too amboyant.  I was too much for her more delicate constitution— that’s the only way I can describe it.  I’m too loud and too de nite in my opinions and too aggressive in my actions.  She had the opposite personality of liking to think about things and being quiet and trying to have a more holistic view of other people’s personalities.","tokens":84},{"text":"” “It sounds like she thought you were more judgmental than she wanted you to be. ” “She always accused me of being judgmental.  I stayed awhile and she told me to go.  She would always tell me when she was tired of me and she needed to rest because she found me tiring. ” “This is in the last months?” “Yes. ” “Why do you think that is? You can’t be tiring.","tokens":98},{"text":"There’s no such thing as a tiring person. ” “My personality would tire her after a while—it was too intense. ” “When does one get tired?” “When you’ve been working.  So you think it was work for her to be with me. ” “She had to work too hard around you. ” “Aha …” “Now you’re wondering why I’m saying that.","tokens":98},{"text":"You’d be very unusual to be open to hearing this, but your whole life has been a search for truth.  I know and understand that.  Look, Barbara came along in your life when there was just no stability at all. ” “That’s right. ” “You were going through the end stages of your relationship with John when you got pregnant with her, and you felt totally alone.","tokens":82},{"text":"You didn’t feel partnered and you began to realize that while this guy was interesting intellectually, emotionally you were quite alone.  Your way of leaving the relationship was to get involved with Wally.  Then you make this ight to Western Canada with the kids in tow.  What ends up happening is that John gets custody of everybody except Barbara Ellen.  She had an awfully huge void to ll in your life all of a sudden, right from the beginning of her life.","tokens":88},{"text":"“The nature of stress is not always the usual stu that people think of.  It’s not the external stress of war or money loss or somebody dying, it is actually the internal stress of having to adjust oneself to somebody else.  Cancer and ALS and MS and rheumatoid arthritis and all these other conditions, it seems to me, happen to people who have a poor sense of themselves as independent persons.","tokens":83},{"text":"On the emotional level, that is—they can be highly accomplished in the arts or intellectually—but on an emotional level they have a poorly di erentiated sense of self.  They live in reaction to others without ever really sensing who they themselves are.  “Barbara’s going from one man to the other shows she hadn’t enough of a sense of self to hold on to.  As soon as one relationship is over, she had to get into another in order to feel okay about herself.","tokens":100},{"text":"The addictions enter into this as well.  “She comes along in your life when you are particularly emotionally needy and exhausted.  I think her precocious intellectual development is what happens to bright and sensitive kids when the emotional environment isn’t able to hold them enough; they develop this very powerful intellect that holds them instead.  Hence their intellectual maturity and their ability to relate to adults.  People would tell me as a child how mature I was.  I always thought I was, because in that mode you can seem highly mature.","tokens":100},{"text":"But then when I look at myself emotionally, I’ve been very immature.  I’m fty-eight now and still trying to grow up. ” “This is very interesting. ” “What doesn’t develop in one area will overdevelop in another, if the kid has the brains for it.  Barbara develops a huge intellect in order to feel comfortable.","tokens":76},{"text":"I believe that’s because you were not able to give her the emotional sustenance that she needed when she was small. ” “I don’t think so either. ” “When the parent can’t put in the work to maintain the relationship, then the child has to.  She does so by being a good girl.  She does it by being precocious, by being intellectually mature.","tokens":82},{"text":"When she reaches the age of abstract thought, around age thirteen or fourteen, when these connections in the brain actually happen, all of a sudden she becomes your intellectual sounding board.  The relationship is based not on her needs but more on yours.  With the incident of that boy trying to climb on her, she protects you from her emotional pain by not telling you.  She doesn’t let you know about it.  She is taking care of you.  “She wants to keep peace in the family.","tokens":95},{"text":"That’s not the child’s role.  The child’s role is to go to her mother and say, ‘This bastard tried to climb on top of me! To hell with whether there is peace or not!’ I know that’s what you would’ve wanted her to do.  None of this is deliberate.  It all goes back to your own experience as a child.","tokens":82},{"text":"“I’ve had very similar interactions with my eldest son as you describe with Barbara.  He said to me at one point, ‘Dad, I don’t know where you end and I begin. ’ That’s just how it is.  I’ve always said that I’m not worried my kids will be angry with me, I’m worried they won’t be angry enough.","tokens":87},{"text":"“What you were nally seeing in Barbara’s last six months of life is that she was beginning to set boundaries.  She was saying no, and the anger that she had repressed was coming out. ” “Right …” “This is how I perceive it.  The people that I see with cancers and all these conditions have di culty saying no and expressing anger.  They tend to repress their anger or, at the very best, express it sarcastically, but never directly.","tokens":100},{"text":"It all comes from the early need to build the relationship with the parent, to work at the relationship.  “I think for Barbara it was a lot of work to maintain the relationship with you.  I recall just very gingerly raising the issue.  She indicated to me that there was something going on, but she also didn’t want to talk very much.  She was very much pulled into herself—I was a total stranger to her.  She wasn’t about to open up to me.","tokens":96},{"text":"” “It wasn’t easy for her to open up.

This is principally due to the fact that most primary lesions are transient and are readily eliminated by DNA repair or cell death.","tokens":88},{"text":"”7 In other words, DNA repairs itself or the cell dies without replicating its damaged genetic material—which, no doubt, accounts for the fact that most smokers do not develop clinical lung cancer.  Where cancer does arise, either DNA repair or the normal process of cell death must have failed.  In a 1999 review of psychological e ects on lung cancer, researchers from the Ohio State University College of Medicine wrote: “Faulty DNA repair is associated with an increased incidence of cancer.","tokens":97},{"text":"Stress may alter these DNA repair mechanisms; for example, in one study, lymphocytes from psychiatric inpatients with higher depressive symptoms demonstrated impairment in their ability to repair cellular DNA damaged by exposure to X-irradiation [X-rays]. ”8 Impaired DNA repair has also been documented in studies of stressed laboratory animals.

In one experiment, researchers manipulated the dominance relationships in groups of female monkeys.","tokens":94},{"text":"Established dominance patterns were broken up.

It is customary to conceive of cancer as an invader against whom the body—like a country under foreign attack—must wage war.  Such a view, while perhaps comforting in its simplicity, is a distortion of reality.

I have known Roy and his family since he was eight.","tokens":92},{"text":"I was their doctor for twenty years, until I left my practice in 2000.  I discovered that Roy had been treated for testicular cancer when I dropped in for a quick visit to my old o ce a few months ago.  By happenstance it was the same afternoon Roy was there for a checkup.  By then I had already read Lance Armstrong’s book, It’s Not about the Bike: My Journey Back to Life.  The parallels in the lives of Roy and Lance were eerie.","tokens":97},{"text":"Perhaps the similarities in their response to disease were more than coincidental.  Long before his cancer, Armstrong had developed a pattern of emotional repression.  One of his close friends described him as “kind of like an iceberg.  There’s a peak, but there is so much more below the surface. ” Armstrong never knew his biological father, whom he contemptuously dismisses as his “DNA donor.","tokens":78},{"text":"” His mother, Linda Mooneyham, the daughter of divorced parents, was seventeen and abandoned when she gave birth to Lance, her rst son.  Linda’s father, an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, gave up drinking, to his credit, the day his grandson was born.  Linda was a spirited and independent-minded young woman but, given her circumstances, also a very needy one, hardly an adult.  As Lance was to write, “In a way, we grew up together.","tokens":97},{"text":"” When Lance was three, Linda remarried.  The stepfather, Terry Armstrong, is described by Lance as “a small man with a large mustache and a habit of acting more successful than he really was. ” He professed Christian principles but, despite them, beat Lance regularly: “The paddle was his preferred method of discipline.  If I came home late, out would come the paddle.  Whack.  If I smarted o , I got the paddle.  Whack.","tokens":94},{"text":"It didn’t hurt just physically, but also emotionally.  So I didn’t like Terry Armstrong.  I thought he was an angry testosterone geek, and as a result, my early impression of organized religion was that it was for hypocrites. ” As the adolescent Lance was to learn, his stepfather also engaged in extramarital a airs.  “I could have dealt with Terry Armstrong’s paddle.","tokens":83},{"text":"But there was something else I couldn’t deal with,” writes Lance, referring to his stepfather’s in delities.  The marriage broke up.  Roy is also the rst-born, the child of an ill-tempered and violent man who used to beat his wife and his son.  “I remember one thing that my dad did.  He tied my wrists and tied my ankles and put me out in the backyard.","tokens":87},{"text":"I don’t remember how long he left me out there, but what really bothered me was the that guy who lived upstairs was looking out the window at me and laughing at me.  How the fuck can you do that to a kid? Obviously it bothers me to this day. ” “Was your mom around?” “I think my mom was at work. ” Roy looked upon his mother as his ally.","tokens":85},{"text":"Very early he took on the role of defending her against her husband’s violence.  Lance Armstrong’s mother was also unable to protect her son from being beaten.  It is inevitable that a child in that situation would have deep hurt around that failure—and anger not only at the abusive stepfather but also at the mother who could not keep him safe.  Lance seems unaware of any such feelings—and that is the source, I believe, of his propensity to deny and ignore his pain.","tokens":96},{"text":"“If it was a su er-fest,” Lance writes about his teenage attraction to endurance sports, “I was good at it. ” As indicated in the passage quoted above, he had greater di culty enduring his mother’s betrayal by her husband than his own harsh treatment.  The child of an unhappy mother will try to take care of her by suppressing his distress so as not to burden her further.","tokens":85},{"text":"His role is to be self-su cient and not “needy”—recall my re exive suppression of a limp after minor knee surgery.  When twenty- ve-year-old Lance was given his cancer diagnosis, he was quite unable to tell his mother directly.  “I wasn’t strong enough to break it to my mother that I was sick,” he writes.  He accepted the o er of a close friend to inform her on his behalf.","tokens":96},{"text":"Linda rose to the challenge with great strength, love and courage, supporting Lance through the nightmare of a highly uncertain prognosis, the bewildering di culties of making the appropriate treatment decisions and the travails of brain surgery and chemotherapy.  Her son’s automatic re ex to protect her was rooted not in their adult realities but in the childhood experiences that had programmed his coping style.","tokens":76},{"text":"The result of Roy’s childhood relationship with his parents, he says, was that “in the past I’ve always seemed to put other people’s happiness before my own.  My self-esteem was very low, so I thought socially that if I made others happy, then they would accept me.  I’d try to satisfy them, doing what I thought they would want me to do.","tokens":83},{"text":"” “How would you do that?” “By not being honest with myself or others.  Always going along with what they wanted to do, or not being honest with them if they said something that hurt.  I would just let that go.  “A few years ago I had a business with two partners.  As far as I was concerned, we were all equal, but it seemed like the way they were running the show, it was all them.  They were in charge.","tokens":95},{"text":"My opinion didn’t matter.  Things like that hurt, but I just suppressed it and kept it in and didn’t say anything.  I didn’t know how to deal with it. ” The crucial di erence, I believe, between Lance Armstrong and Roy on the one hand, and Francis on the other, is that the rst two had had enough love in their lives to hold on to the part of themselves that allowed for the development of a ghting spirit.","tokens":97},{"text":"Unlike Francis, they also both received powerful caring and support from family and friends when they were diagnosed.  I strongly suspect that repression plays a role in the onset of testicular malignancy.  It would be worthwhile for someone to undertake a study in which men with the disease were carefully interviewed about how they experienced their lives emotionally.  One aspect deserving attention would be the patients’ level of closeness to and identi cation with their mothers.","tokens":85},{"text":"There is—I don’t believe coincidentally—an uncanny resemblance in looks between Lance’s mother, and his wife, Kik.  In a photograph of the three of them in Armstrong’s riveting memoir, one can hardly tell the two women apart.  One of the lessons Roy spontaneously drew from his experience of cancer was to refuse to orient his behaviour any longer to pleasing others without considering the cost to himself.","tokens":84},{"text":"“Whatever I do now, it is de nitely not to please anyone else,” he says.  “What is going to make me happy? Is this what I want to do? I’ve tried it the other way in the past, and it didn’t work out for me. ” Francis was admitted to palliative care, in the end.

People of Celtic origin appear to be especially vulnerable, particularly if, like Jimmy, they have light-coloured hair, freckles and blue or grey eyes.

Until I left my practice two years ago, Linda and her children remained my patients.","tokens":82},{"text":"When I called her recently, she agreed to be interviewed for this book, as did Donna, Jimmy’s older sister.  I asked Linda to describe her late husband’s personality.  “Jimmy was easygoing, laid-back and relaxed.  He loved to be around people.  I had to think when you asked me about what kind of stresses there were in his life.  He wasn’t a very stressed out kind of person.  Now, he was a drinker.  He had to drink pretty much every day.","tokens":100},{"text":"That’s why I wouldn’t marry him all those years, because of the drinking.  He had beer every day—at least four or more. ” “Did it change him at all?” “Only if he had a lot more than that….

Guys, too, like they were his big brothers.","tokens":96},{"text":"He needed to say to a guy, ‘You’re my buddy,’ and then he would cry.  “He wasn’t a violent man, he wasn’t angry or frustrated.  He was sad.

He did not talk about his emotions.  He did not share anything, really. ” “What kind of a childhood had he had?” “He grew up in Halifax.  He always said he was a happy kid.  His parents stayed together.  Both his parents were alcoholics—the father, from what I understand, drank a lot for a long time.  I think the mother started when Jimmy was a teenager.","tokens":88},{"text":"” As I found out later from Jimmy’s sister, Donna, his senior by two years, their father had been a heavy drinker throughout their childhood.  Donna and I had two conversations.  “I felt very comfortable with my childhood,” she told me at rst.  “My younger siblings have a di erent perspective … but I believe we had a very good upbringing.  Very happy household … “Jimmy was a real little boy, a happy kid.","tokens":94},{"text":"We’d play all the time.  We’d go out into the backyard and have water ghts—you know, those little spray guns.  I just see him as a kid with a real happy face. ” “How do you recall your parents?” “My father was the nicest, friendliest man around.  He was a very funny man.  He was always joking around with us, play- ghting with us, tickling.","tokens":91},{"text":"He used to mimic, used to talk like Donald Duck.  People would come over and say, ‘Get your father to talk like a duck. ’ “He was a comical person, but you had to listen to him.  We’d joke around with him, but when Dad spoke, the ground shook….  When he was annoyed or angry, when enough was enough—that was it.  If he told us to do something, you did it.","tokens":90},{"text":"” “Why?” “Because if not, you’d be punished and yelled at. ” Donna married and moved to a di erent town when she was nineteen.  Jimmy stayed with his parents until the age of twenty- two.  On what was to have been a brief trip to Vancouver, ostensibly to see a friend, he called to tell his parents he would not be back.  He did not return, except for a rare visit.","tokens":90},{"text":"“He just called and said he wasn’t coming home.  He left a letter in his top drawer, explaining it. ” “He escaped. ” “He did.  And the reason why, I remember him saying to my parents, ‘Hey, I couldn’t tell you, because I didn’t want to hurt you…’” “So Jimmy had the feeling that it would hurt his parents for him to be an independent person.","tokens":97},{"text":"” “All of us were made to feel that way.  For our mother, her children were her world.  They were her everything.  She tried to do the best she could, but she was very attached to us—even to my detriment but especially to Jimmy’s.  In retrospect, I realize we were far too attached, to an unhealthy degree.  I think at some point you have to let your children go.  I think emotionally, she didn’t let go.","tokens":92},{"text":"I felt obligated, and many times Jimmy did, too.  Normally your parents would try to understand and accept your separateness as you got older. ” “Jimmy’s escape to the West Coast physically doesn’t mean that he liberated himself internally. ” “Of course he didn’t, no.  He felt terrible.  He felt very, very bad.  He did it, but he also had to live with the feelings.","tokens":86},{"text":"” According to Donna, Jimmy found the burden of his parents’ emotional pain unbearable even at the end of his life.  “Just before the Labour Day weekend, my brother phoned me.  He told me what was going on with the melanoma, but he said, ‘You know, Donna, I can’t phone Mom and Dad, because emotionally I can’t handle it.  Could you do it for me?’ I said sure, I’ll do it.","tokens":100},{"text":"So he said, ‘Just make sure that they don’t call me all upset and crying and everything, because I couldn’t take it. ’” I suggested to Donna that perhaps what she had recalled as Jimmy’s childhood “real happy face” might not have been a genuine face at all.  At least in part, it could have been a coping mechanism Jimmy adopted in reaction to his parents’ anxieties and anger.","tokens":93},{"text":"It was a way of avoiding the painful impact of their emotions on himself.  Soothing his parents’ feelings was accomplished by negating his own.  Donna called me back a few days later.  Our conversation had brought to the forefront many memories.  She needed to talk.  “After you and I spoke, I just went on about my day.  I went to bed at night.  About four o’clock in the morning I woke up.  It was just incredible how many things came out and just kept going through my mind.","tokens":99},{"text":"“You had mentioned Linda saying that Jimmy had a lot of sadness in him, maybe to do with his dad.  I knew Jimmy really, really well, and yes, there was a lot of sadness.  I can go way back to the beginning, remembering when he was little.  The only time I can recall my dad doing anything with my brother was a little bit of roughhousing on the carpet in the living room.  And I see a bunch of smiles and laughs.","tokens":90},{"text":"But other than that, there was never any participation in Jimmy’s life.  Never went to the hockey games.  Never played with him.  “The crazy thing is that our father always said that he loved us, but he could be so hurtful.  I have a brother who is quite heavy, and he’d ridicule him in front of people.  He’d say some terrible things to him.  And to Jimmy, too.","tokens":84},{"text":"“I was never angry with my father—I’ve always covered up for him, maybe knowingly, maybe in an unknowing way.  That night, all of a sudden, I got so angry.  I started to think of Jimmy and all the things that happened as he was growing up and throughout his life.  I kept thinking of all the times my father raised his voice.","tokens":74},{"text":"If he was trying to x something and he didn’t have the right tools, or the screws fell on the oor, or if something didn’t happen exactly the way it was supposed to happen, he would scream and yell, and we were scared.

This is not what we should have experienced.","tokens":91},{"text":"“Even at the end … My father came out to see Jimmy—they drove from Halifax.  Actually, my sister and her husband did all the driving; my father drank all the way.  They arrived a couple of weeks before Jimmy had to go into palliative care.  My father walked into the apartment and sat there sipping his beer, not wanting even to go into the bedroom to see his son, to see Jim.  “We were trying to cover up.","tokens":91},{"text":"We didn’t want Jimmy to realize that his father couldn’t face seeing him—was afraid to see what he was going to look like.","tokens":31},{"text":"Finally, Dad built up enough courage and went into the room, and asked, ‘Jimmy, can I get you anything? Is there something that you want?’ “My father came out, went to the fridge, and all of a sudden he said, ‘How come there’s no apple juice here? I don’t believe this!’ And he started ranting and raving at all of us in the apartment.  We were stunned.","tokens":96},{"text":"Got his coat on and stomped o to the store and came back with apple juice for Jimmy.  “Then my father went home, and that was it.  He never saw Jimmy in the hospital.  He went back to Halifax and never saw him again.

After the wedding, he was weak, but he held his hand up and said, ‘Look, look, just like Dad’s ring. ’ And his wedding band was identical to my father’s.  It’s funny, those were the words that came out of Jimmy’s mouth.  Just like Dad’s ring.","tokens":97},{"text":"” Jimmy’s mode of emotional coping has been extensively documented among melanoma patients.  An elegant study in 1984 measured the physiological responses to stressful stimuli of three groups: melanoma patients, people with heart disease and a control cohort with no medical illness.

Jimmy’s story, related by his wife and sister, illustrates that repression, “niceness” and lack of aggression are lifelong patterns, having their origins in early childhood.","tokens":80},{"text":"As the researchers who studied physiological stress responses in melanoma patients noted, “When people are diagnosed with a disease—whether cancer or cardiovascular—they do not precipitously change their usual ways of coping with stress or suddenly develop new patterns….

Hormonal factors likely account for the fact that the number of melanoma tumours is increasing in bodily sites not exposed to sunlight.","tokens":98},{"text":"Researchers have suggested that hormones may be overstimulating the pigment-producing cells. 4 The Type C personality traits associated with melanoma have been found in studies of many other cancers as well.

They may even harbour self-loathing for certain traits—for example, when a person describes herself as “a control freak.","tokens":99},{"text":"” In reality, there is no innate human inclination to be controlling.  What there is in a “controlling” personality is deep anxiety.  The infant and child who perceives that his needs are unmet may develop an obsessive coping style, anxious about each detail.

Unconsciously he believes that only by controlling every aspect of his life and environment will he be able to ensure the satisfaction of his needs.","tokens":97},{"text":"As he grows older, others will resent him and he will come to dislike himself for what was originally a desperate response to emotional deprivation.

Both are characterized by in ammation of the bowel but in di erent patterns.","tokens":88},{"text":"In ulcerative colitis, the more common of the two, the in ammation begins in the rectum and spreads upward.

IBD may be associated with in ammation in the joints, the eyes and the skin.","tokens":100},{"text":"The symptoms of IBD depend on the site of involvement.  Diarrhea is common in both diseases, along with abdominal pain.  Patients may need to defecate many times during the day or even nd themselves incontinent.

In fact, research shows that “most people with in ammatory bowel disease believe that stress is a major contributor to illness. ” 2 For Martha, the immediate stressor in the year before her visit to the Mayo had been the departure of her two teenage daughters, who both left home to attend universities in California.  She had relied on them for emotional support.","tokens":97},{"text":"Her husband continued to be emotionally abusive, and by then he had exchanged his drinking for a gambling habit.

Dr.  Drossman has been a leading advocate of seeing intestinal diseases as expressions not only of disturbed physiology but also of stressed lives.  He wrote a seminal article on the subject in 1998.  “On the basis of clinical reports, on appraisal of the existing research literature, and clinical experience, I believe there is at least indirect evidence that psychosocial factors do a ect disease susceptibility and activity.","tokens":100},{"text":"The most likely mechanism for this to occur would be through psychoimmunological pathways. ”5 The in ammation of IBD is the result of disordered immune activity in the gut.  Beyond their functions of digestion and absorption, the intestines are also one of the body’s major barriers to invasion.  Whatever is in the gut is simply passing through and still belongs to the external world.  Only after penetrating the bowel lining do substances and organisms enter the body proper.","tokens":92},{"text":"Since this protective function of the gut tissue is critical to well-being, it is generously supplied with its own local immune system, one that works in coordination with the body’s general immune defences.  In ammation is an ingenious process invoked by the body to isolate and destroy hostile organisms or noxious particles.  It does so by tissue swelling and the in ux of a host of immune cells and antibodies.","tokens":81},{"text":"To facilitate its defensive function, the lining, or mucosa, of the bowel is in a “state of perpetually controlled or orchestrated in ammation. ” 6 That is its normal state in healthy people.  The powerful destructive forces of the immune apparatus must be minutely regulated and kept in such a balance that they are able to carry out their policing duties without harming the delicate body tissues they are charged with defending.  Some substances promote in ammation; others inhibit it.","tokens":93},{"text":"If the balance is upset, disease can result.  A diminished capacity by the gut to mount an in ammatory response would invite life-threatening infections.  On the other hand, an inability to dampen in ammation exposes the gut tissue to self- injury.  The central abnormality in in ammatory bowel disease would appear to be just such an imbalance of what one journal article calls the “pro-in ammatory and anti-in ammatory” molecules in the bowel lining.","tokens":99},{"text":"Emotional in uences acting through the nerve and immune pathways of the PNI super-system could tip the balance in favour of in ammation.  As Canadian researchers have pointed out, “many, if not all, aspects of gut physiology may be regulated by neuroimmune factors. ”7 The nervous system is deeply in uenced by emotions.  In turn, the nervous system is intimately involved in the regulation of immune responses and of in ammation.","tokens":90},{"text":"Neuropeptides, protein molecules secreted by nerve cells, serve to promote in ammation or to inhibit it.  Such molecules are found in heavy concentration in the intestines, in the areas most vulnerable to IBD.  They are implicated both in the regulation of local in ammation and in the body’s stress response.","tokens":66},{"text":"For example, a neuropeptide called substance P is a powerful stimulator of in ammation because it induces certain immune cells to release in ammatory chemicals such as histamine and prostaglandins, among many others.  In the gut, immune cells are closely associated with nerve cells.  Chronically stressful emotional patterns could induce in ammatory disease in the gut, through the mediation of the PNI super-system and the activation of pro-in ammatory molecules by stress.","tokens":98},{"text":"The gut, or intestinal tract, is much more than an organ of digestion.  It is a sensory apparatus with a nervous system of its own, intimately connected to the brain’s emotional centres.  Everyone intuitively understands the meaning of the phrase “gut-wrenching” as a description of emotionally upsetting events.  Many of us can recall experiencing the sore tummy of the anxious child.","tokens":78},{"text":"Gut feelings, pleasant or unpleasant, are part of the body’s normal response to the world—they help us to interpret what is happening around us and inform us whether we are safe or in danger.  Nausea and pain or a warm, comforting feeling in the tummy are sensations that orient us to the meaning of events.  The gut secretes its own neurotransmitters and is in uenced by the body’s general hormonal system.","tokens":89},{"text":"The gut also forms an important part of the body’s barrier against noxious substances and plays a major role in immune defence.  Its functioning is inseparable from the psychological processing that each moment gauges and reacts to the stimuli presented to us by the environment.  The ability of gut tissue to maintain its integrity is heavily in uenced by psychological factors, and its resistance to in ammation and even to malignant change is also vulnerable to emotional stress.","tokens":89},{"text":"A species of New World monkey, the cotton-topped tamarin, develops ulcerative colitis and cancer of the colon when captured and caged. 8 A 1999 Italian study showed that in ulcerative colitis, “long-term perceived stress increases the risk of exacerbation over a period of months to years. ” 9 In 1997 Dr.","tokens":71},{"text":"Noel Hersh eld, the Calgary gastroenterologist whose timely letter to the editor sparked my own interest in psychoneuroimmunology some years ago, published an article in the Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology.","tokens":43},{"text":"He pointed out that in clinical trials of medications for in ammatory bowel disease, there have been instances of placebo response in the range of 60 per cent and that in others comparing narcotics with placebo drugs for pain control, the number of patients who obtained the placebo e ect was consistent at 55 per cent of the response.

It is not unusual for IBS patients to describe stool that is lumpy or small and pellet-like or, on the other hand, loose and watery.

They frequently describe passing mucus with their stool.","tokens":94},{"text":"A sensation of bloating or abdominal distension is also common.

Estimated gut wall tension at di erent volumes was similar in the two groups.  However, the incidence of pain in relation to wall tension was increased by nearly ten-fold in the IBS group. ”4 Parallel observations have been made elsewhere in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the small intestine.","tokens":89},{"text":"It appears, then, that in functional abdominal pain, physiological messages from the gut are transmitted by the nervous system and received by the brain in an altered fashion.  “There is a new area of investigation for patients with these disorders,” Dr.  Drossman writes.  “After decades of studying how IBS patients are distinguished from normals with regard to their gastrointestinal physiology, we are beginning to see di erences in brain physiology.","tokens":86},{"text":"” A type of scan known as positron emission tomography, or PET, measures the activity of brain regions by recording variations in blood ow.  When study subjects experience distension of their rectums, a PET scan will indicate which part of the brain registers a response.  With rectal distension, or even the anticipation of rectal distension, IBS patients activated the prefrontal cortex, an area not activated in normals. 5 The prefrontal cortex is where the brain stores emotional memories.","tokens":95},{"text":"It interprets present stimuli, whether physical or psychological, in light of past experiences, which can date as far back as infancy.  Activation in this part of the brain means that some event of emotional signi cance is occurring.  In people who have experienced chronic stress, the prefrontal cortex and related structures remain in a state of hypervigilance, on the lookout for danger.","tokens":73},{"text":"Prefrontal activation is not a conscious decision by the individual; rather, it is the result of the automatic triggering of nerve pathways programmed long ago.  In another investigation, the electrical amplitudes of brainwaves evoked by sound stimuli were greater in IBS patients than in controls, again indicating a physiological hypervigilance. 6 What accounts for these altered nervous-system responses? The answer emerges when we look not only at human organs but at human lives.","tokens":89},{"text":"There is a high incidence of abuse in the histories of patients with intestinal diseases and especially in those patients with IBS and other functional disorders.  In a 1990 study of women patients conducted at the gastroenterology clinic of the North Carolina School of Medicine, 44 per cent of the women reported some type of sexual and/or physical abuse.  “Those with abuse history had a four-fold greater risk of pelvic pain, two to three times more non-abdominal symptoms (e. g.","tokens":96},{"text":", headaches, backaches, fatigue), as well as more lifetime surgeries. ”7 In a more recent investigation at the same centre, fully two-thirds of the women interviewed had experienced abuse of a physical or sexual nature, or both.  Again, abused patients were more likely to undergo various surgeries, such as gallbladder operations, hysterectomies, and laparotomies.","tokens":78},{"text":"They also had “more pain, non- gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, bed disability days, psychological distress, and functional disability compared to those without sexual abuse. ”8 It is self-evident that direct physical trauma—a severe brain contusion or the cutting or bruising of a nerve—could physiologically disrupt the nervous system.","tokens":66},{"text":"But how does psychological trauma exert its e ect on the perception of pain? The nervous system of the gut contains about one hundred million nerve cells—we have as many in the small intestine alone as there are in our entire spine!9 These nerves do more than coordinate the digestion and absorption of food and the elimination of waste—they also form part of our sensory apparatus.  The gut responds to emotional stimuli by muscle contractions, blood ow changes and the secretion of a multitude of biologically active substances.","tokens":97},{"text":"Such brain-gut integration is essential for survival.  Large volumes of blood, for example, may need to be diverted from the intestines to the heart and to the muscles of the limbs at a moment’s notice.  In turn, the gut is abundantly supplied with sensory nerves that carry information to the brain.  Quite to the contrary of what was believed until recently, nerve bres ascending from the intestines to the brain greatly outnumber ones descending from brain to gut.","tokens":92},{"text":"10 The brain relays to the gut data from sensory organs such as the eyes, the skin or the ears—or more correctly, relayed to the gut is the interpretation of such data by the brain’s emotional centres.  The resulting physiological events in the gut then reinforce that emotional interpretation.  The signals sent back to the brain give rise to gut feelings that we can apprehend consciously.  If we lose touch with gut feelings, the world becomes less safe.","tokens":87},{"text":"Obviously, life would not be livable if we felt every micro-event in our bodies.  Digestion, breathing, blood ow to organs or limbs and myriad other functions must take place without intruding on consciousness.  There has to be a threshold below which the brain does not register sensation, below which stimuli are accepted as unremarkable but above which the brain will be alerted to potential danger from within or without.","tokens":79},{"text":"There needs to be, in other words, a well-calibrated thermostat for pain and other sensations.  When there are too many “gut-wrenching” experiences, the neurological apparatus can become oversensitized.  Thus, in the spinal cord the conduction of pain from gut to brain is adjusted as a result of psychological trauma.  The nerves involved are set o by weaker stimuli.  The greater the trauma, the lower becomes the sensory threshold.","tokens":91},{"text":"A normal amount of gas in the intestinal lumen and a normal level of tension in the intestinal wall will trigger pain in the sensitized person.  At the same time, the prefrontal areas of the cortex will be in a heightened state of vigilance, responding with distress to normal physiological processes.  Along with increased pain, IBS patients report higher levels of anxiety, arousal and fatigue during rectal distension than do healthy people.  During emotional stress, activity of the cortical regions ampli es the perception of distress.

External stressors include abuse during childhood and other pathological stresses, which alter stress responsiveness and make a predisposed individual more vulnerable to developing IBS.","tokens":83},{"text":"Later in life, infections, surgery, antibiotics and psychosocial stressors can all contribute to IBS onset and exacerbation. ”11 Stress can de nitely induce contractions of the intestines.  Women who have been sexually abused, for example, are prone to constipation when the muscles in their pelvic oor are chronically tight, incapable of relaxing with defecation.  Alternatively, as people who have been terribly frightened have experienced, stress can set o uncontrollable movements in the colon.","tokens":96},{"text":"That was graphically illustrated in a young doctor-to-be who became an unwitting guinea pig in an experiment: “The investigators produced an elaborate hoax by suggesting to a fourth-year medical student undergoing a voluntary sigmoidoscopic examination that they were seeing a cancer.

There was, they said, a tiny bit of acid, but not enough to cause the degree of pain I’m having.","tokens":99},{"text":"“I’ve been on Pantoloc for about three or four years.  It’s supposed to wipe out acid completely, and I was only supposed to take it for six weeks.  I also take Diovol or Gaviscon every day.

Researchers in 1992 studied the relationship of re ux symptoms to stress in subjects diagnosed with GERD.  While the perception of re ux-associated heartburn by these patients was markedly increased during the stressful stimuli, the objective measures of acid levels were unchanged from one stimulus to another.  Stress, in other words, lowered the pain threshold.","tokens":99},{"text":"13 An intestinal specialist unfamiliar with the neurophysiology or psychology of pain who looked at Patricia’s lower esophagus through an endoscope could, in good conscience, tell her that the acid re ux he observed was inadequate to explain the degree of her pain.  And Patricia, in equally good conscience, would be incensed by what she perceived as the callous dismissal of a symptom that is a source of intense daily discomfort in her life.","tokens":89},{"text":"This is not to say that people with GERD do not experience more frequent re ux than other people.  They probably do, and, once more, it is a brain-gut problem.  Investigators comparing healthy controls with re ux patients found that the resting pressure of the esophageal sphincter was more frequently low in the GERD subjects.  The decreased e ciency of the sphincter muscles permitted more episodes of re ux.","tokens":90},{"text":"14 How can the mind and the brain contribute to re ux? It happens by means of the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the tone of the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter.  In turn, the activity of the vagus is in uenced by the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus, as we have seen, receives input from the emotional centres in the cortex that are susceptible to stress.","tokens":84},{"text":"Thus, in GERD, a lower pain threshold is combined with excessive relaxation of the sphincter— both phenomena that can be related to stress.  The three women interviewed for this chapter described similar pain experiences, though it is only Patricia whose constellation of symptoms meet the full diagnostic criteria for IBS.  Unlike the majority of patients in the North Carolina studies, none of these women su ered sexual or physical abuse either as children or as adults.","tokens":87},{"text":"How, then, can we explain their lowered pain thresholds? The downward calibration of the nervous system’s pain “thermostat” does not require abuse; chronic emotional stress is su cient to diminish the pain threshold and to induce hypervigilance in the brain.  While abuse would be a major source of such stress, there are other potential stresses on the developing child that are subtle, less visible, but harmful nonetheless.","tokens":87},{"text":"Such strains are present in many families, with parents who love their children and would be horri ed by any thought of hurting them.

The observations at one year are accurate advance indicators of behaviour at adolescence, including such features as emotional maturity, peer relationships and academic performance.","tokens":81},{"text":"On all these measures, children who had been securely attached infants scored consistently better than insecurely attached ones.  However, as Daniel Siegel explains in his book The Developing Mind, the most crucial nding concerning the intergenerational transmission of parenting was that the infant’s performance in the Strange Situation could be accurately predicted even before the child was born.

It turns out that “the AAI is the most robust predictor of how infants become attached to their parents. ” In other words, what an adult unconsciously reveals about his own childhood during the course of the attachment interview will predict his own attachment patterns with his children.","tokens":95},{"text":"Thus, AAIs conducted with the parent before the birth of an infant was able to forecast accurately how the infant would behave in the Strange Situation at one year of life.  Furthermore, when those children are followed two decades later, their performance in the Strange Situation is found to have accurately predicted their own patterns of narrative in the Adult Attachment Interview.","tokens":67},{"text":"Thus, the adult’s AAI narrative of his own childhood will often predict how he will nurture his future child, and therefore how his child, at one year, will respond in the Strange Situation.

We can learn to read symptoms not only as problems to be overcome but as messages to be heeded.  3.","tokens":92},{"text":"Anger “I never get angry,” a Woody Allen character says in one of his movies, “I grow a tumour instead. ” Throughout this book we have seen the truth of that droll remark in numerous studies of cancer patients.  We have also seen that the repression of anger is a major risk factor for disease because it increases physiological stress on the organism.","tokens":74},{"text":"Not only does the repression of anger predispose to disease but the experience of anger has been shown to promote healing or, at least, to prolong survival.  People with cancer who have been able to muster anger at their physicians, for example, have lived longer than their more placid counterparts.  In animal experiments the expression of anger has been found to be less physiologically stressful than the suppression of it.","tokens":77},{"text":"In rats who ght others when caged together, slower growth of tumours has been found than in more docile animals.  Studies apart, we have seen that every one of the interviewees in the previous chapters acknowledged di culties around the communication of anger, no matter what their disease or condition.  “The way my stepmother raised me, I think I’m not supposed to be angry,” said Shizuko, with rheumatoid arthritis.","tokens":94},{"text":"“I was short- circuiting my visceral expression of anger,” said Magda, with severe abdominal pain.  Here the issue of anger becomes confusing and raises many questions.  How can we encourage people to be angry when we see that children su er from their parents’ outbursts? In many of the patient histories we have seen a similar pattern: a raging parent, a repressed child.","tokens":81},{"text":"Should Magda’s father have suppressed his anger? “I kept thinking of all the times my father raised his voice,” said Donna, whose brother Jimmy died of malignant melanoma.  “I remembered his voice and the screaming and the yelling, and I thought, This is not how you should live.  This is not what we should have experienced. ” On the surface, it seems like a paradox.","tokens":84},{"text":"If the expression of anger is “good,” Magda’s father and the father of Jimmy and Donna were only acting in a healthy fashion.  Yet the e ect of their anger was corrosive to their children’s self-concept and health.  Suppressing anger may have negative consequences, but should we encourage its expression if it harms others? The mystery only deepens.","tokens":77},{"text":"Not only is the unbridled outpouring of anger harmful to the recipients or bystanders but it can also be deadly to the one who rages.  Heart attacks can follow upon outbursts of rage.  In general, high blood pressure and heart disease are more likely to happen in persons who harbour hostility.","tokens":58},{"text":"A study of nearly two hundred men and women conducted at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, in 2000 found that hostility and a drive for dominance were “signi cant independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. ”7 A great volume of research has connected hostility with high blood pressure and coronary disease.  As we can readily deduce by now, the relationship between rage and cardiovascular disease is also a function of the psycho-neuro- immune apparatus.  The sympathetic nerves are activated in rage states.","tokens":98},{"text":"Narrowing of the blood vessels occurs with excessive sympathetic ight-or- ght activity, increasing the blood pressure and decreasing oxygen supply to the heart.

The blind rage that later triggered Morrow’s heart attacks was the volcanic eruption of the anger a child learned to repress in his family of origin.","tokens":70},{"text":"How then to resolve the dilemma of anger? If the expression of anger is harmful and so is its repression, how do we hope to attain health and healing? The repression of anger and the unregulated acting-out of it are both examples of the abnormal release of emotions that is at the root of disease.  If in repression the problem is a lack of release, acting out consists of an equally abnormal suppression of release alternating with unregulated and exaggerated venting.","tokens":88},{"text":"I had a fascinating conversation on these two seemingly opposite ways of coping with Allen Kalpin, a physician and psychotherapist in Toronto.  He points out that both repression and rage represent a fear of the genuine experience of anger.  I found Kalpin’s description of genuine anger surprising, even as it rang completely true to me.  His explanation made me realize the confusion in our commonly received ideas about this emotion.  Healthy anger, he says, is an empowerment and a relaxation.","tokens":91},{"text":"The real experience of anger “is physiologic experience without acting out.  The experience is one of a surge of power going through the system, along with a mobilization to attack.  There is, simultaneously, a complete disappearance of all anxiety.  “When healthy anger is starting to be experienced, you don’t see anything dramatic.  What you do see is a decrease of all muscle tension.","tokens":75},{"text":"The mouth is opening wider, because the jaws are more relaxed, the voice is lower in pitch because the vocal cords are more relaxed.  The shoulders drop, and you see all signs of muscle tension disappearing. ” Dr.  Kalpin’s mode of therapy works along the lines rst developed by Dr.  Habib Davanloo of McGill University, Montreal.  Davanloo made a practice of videotaping his clients during therapy encounters so that they themselves could see their bodily manifestations of emotion.","tokens":94},{"text":"Kalpin, too, tapes some of his psychotherapy sessions.  “In a tape of one of my clients, he describes powerful surges of electricity going through his body—and he talks about them as they’re happening—but outwardly he’s just sitting there describing it.  If you’re watching the tape without the sound on, you’ll see a person looking quite focused and quite relaxed, but you wouldn’t necessarily even guess that the person was angry.","tokens":99},{"text":"” If anger is relaxation, what then is rage? When I am in a rage, my face is tight, my muscles are tense and I am sure I look anything but relaxed.  Here Dr.  Kalpin makes a crucial distinction.  “The question is, What do people really experience when they experience rage? It’s fascinating to ask people.  If you really ask, the majority of people will describe anxiety.","tokens":81},{"text":"If you ask in physical, physiologic terms what they are experiencing in their body when they feel rage, for the most part, people will describe anxiety in one form or another. ” “It’s true,” I said, “tightening of the voice, shallow breathing, muscle tension are signs of anxiety, not of anger. ” “Exactly.  Their anger is not physiologically experienced, it is only being acted out.","tokens":90},{"text":"” Acting out through bursts of rage is a defence against the anxiety that invariably accompanies anger in a child.  Anger triggers anxiety because it coexists with positive feelings, with love and the desire for contact.  But since anger leads to an attacking energy, it threatens attachment.  Thus there is something basically anxiety- provoking about the anger experience, even without external, parental injunctions against anger expression.","tokens":75},{"text":"“Aggressive impulses are suppressed because of guilt, and the guilt exists only because of the simultaneous existence of love, of positive feelings,” says Allen Kalpin.  “So, the anger doesn’t exist in a vacuum by itself.  It is incredibly anxiety-provoking and guilt-producing for a person to experience aggressive feelings toward a loved one. ” Naturally, the more parents discourage or forbid the experience of anger, the more anxiety-producing that experience will be for the child.","tokens":99},{"text":"In all cases where anger is completely repressed or where chronic repression alternates with explosive eruptions of rage, the early childhood history was one in which the parents were unable to accept the child’s natural anger.  If a person unconsciously fears the power of his aggressive impulses, there are various forms of defence available to him.  One category of defence is discharge, by which we regress to an early childhood state when we dealt with the intolerable buildup of anger by acting it out.","tokens":93},{"text":"“You see, the acting-out, the yelling, the screaming and even the hitting, all that a person does, serves as a defence against the experience of the anger.  It’s a defence against keeping the anger inside where it can be deeply felt.  Discharge defends against anger being actually experienced. ” The other way we can avoid the experience of anger is through repression.  So repression and discharge are two sides of the same coin.","tokens":87},{"text":"Both represent fear and anxiety, and for that reason, both trigger physiological stress responses regardless of what we consciously feel or do not feel.  The paralyzing di culty many people have with anger toward loved ones is illustrated repeatedly in the interviews we have seen.  Jean, unable to tell her parents about being molested at age eleven, idealizes her relationship with them rather than acknowledge her anger.","tokens":75},{"text":"Her husband, Ed, has a corrosive resentment toward what he regards as controlling behaviour from his wife but cannot experience anger openly and directly.  Jill, with ovarian cancer, is upset with her doctors for having missed the diagnosis but not at her husband, Chris, for having failed to notice her pain and weight loss over several months.  Leslie, with ulcerative colitis, “swallowed” his anger toward his rst wife.  “No question about it.","tokens":92},{"text":"I couldn’t ght because then she would say, ‘You see, this is a bad marriage. ’” He is delighted to nd himself in a marriage now where the experience of anger does not threaten the relationship.  The anxiety of anger and other “negative” emotions like sadness and rejection may become deeply bound in the body.","tokens":71},{"text":"Eventually it is transmuted into biological changes through the multiple and in nitely subtle cross-connections of the PNI apparatus, the unifying nexus of body/mind.  This is the route that leads to organic disease.  When anger is disarmed, so is the immune system.  Or when the aggressive energy of anger is diverted inward, the immune system becomes confused.  Our physiological defences no longer protect us or may even turn mutinous, attacking the body.","tokens":87},{"text":"“It may prove valuable to regard cancer less as a disease than as a disorder in the body’s biochemical signals,” writes the psychotherapist Luis Ormont, who has worked with mobilizing people’s anger in group therapy with cancer patients.  “To alter these signals is to produce an impact on the body’s immunological defenses.  It would follow that any form of intervention designed to restore the body to physical health must use more than physical means.","tokens":96},{"text":"Since emotions dramatically in uence the biochemical system, one way of providing immunotherapy is by giving psychotherapy to patients. ”8 People diagnosed with cancer or with autoimmune disease, with chronic fatigue or bromyalgia, or with potentially debilitating neurological conditions, are often enjoined to relax, to think positively, to lower their stress levels.  All that is good advice, but impossible to carry out if one of the major sources of stress is not clearly identi ed and dealt with: the internalization of anger.","tokens":100},{"text":"Anger does not require hostile acting out.  First and foremost, it is a physiological process to be experienced.  Second, it has cognitive value—it provides essential information.  Since anger does not exist in a vacuum, if I feel anger it must be in response to some perception on my part.  It may be a response to loss or the threat of it in a personal relationship, or it may signal a real or threatened invasion of my boundaries.","tokens":83},{"text":"I am greatly empowered without harming anyone if I permit myself to experience the anger and to contemplate what may have triggered it.  Depending on circumstances, I may choose to manifest the anger in some way or to let go of it.  The key is that I have not suppressed the experience of it.  I may choose to display my anger as necessary in words or in deeds, but I do not need to act it out in a driven fashion as uncontrolled rage.","tokens":86},{"text":"Healthy anger leaves the individual, not the unbridled emotion, in charge.  “Anger is the energy Mother Nature gives us as little kids to stand forward on our own behalf and say I matter,” says the therapist Joann Peterson, who conducts workshops on Gabriola Island, in British Columbia.  “The di erence between the healthy energy of anger and the hurtful energy of emotional and physical violence is that anger respects boundaries.","tokens":89},{"text":"Standing forward on your own behalf does not invade anyone else’s boundaries. ” 4.  Autonomy Illness not only has a history but also tells a history.  It is a culmination of a lifelong history of struggle for self.  From a simple biological perspective, it may appear that the survival of the physical organism ought to be nature’s ultimate goal.  It would seem, however, that the existence of an autonomous, self- regulating psyche is nature’s higher purpose.","tokens":93},{"text":"Mind and spirit can survive grievous physical injury, but time and again we see that the physical body begins to succumb when psychic integrity and freedom are jeopardized.  Jason has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since he was ve.  Diabetes mellitus derives its name from the Greek for “sweet urine,” for in this disease excess sugar is ltered by the kidneys from the bloodstream into the urine.","tokens":78},{"text":"In diabetes the gland cells of the pancreas are unable to produce enough insulin, the hormone required to help sugar from digested food to enter the cells.  Apart from the immediate physiological risks of high glucose levels, diabetes involves potential damage to many organs of the body.

He also su ers from weakened cardiac muscles, a leaking heart valve and malfunctioning kidneys.","tokens":88},{"text":"At times he is unable to walk, owing to a reversible nerve in ammation called diabetic neuropathy.  Jason and his mother, Heather, were my patients for about ten years.  In the past twelve months, he has had to be rushed to emergency repeatedly for medical crises including heart failure and meningitis.  He may not have many more years to live.  According to his internal medicine specialist, his prognosis is “guarded.","tokens":84},{"text":"” Heather is in a chronic state of anxiety and exhaustion mingled with resentment, which she believes are due to Jason’s sti -necked refusal to take care of himself when it comes to eating the right kinds of food, paying close attention to his insulin requirements, attending medical appointments and having a healthy lifestyle.  Of course, for a mother, the stakes are high.  Her experience has been that when she does not take charge, Jason becomes ill.","tokens":91},{"text":"She has lived many years with the very real possibility that were she to relax her guard, even for a day, Jason could end up in a coma, or worse.  His most recent hospitalization followed a several-week bout of vomiting that left him weak, dehydrated and in convulsions.  Heather was by his bedside one day when Jason had another seizure.  “Nurses, residents and specialists came running,” she relates.","tokens":86},{"text":"“Jason’s eyes were rolling backward, and his arms and legs were shaking.  They were injecting medications through the IV in his arm when he sat straight up, opened his eyes and looked straight at me.  In a loud voice he said, ‘Let go!’ But I can’t let go.  I will not let my son die. ” Jason does not recall the incident.  “I must have been really out of it,” he says.","tokens":94},{"text":"“Any idea what you might have meant?” I ask.  “The rst thing that springs to mind is just to let me go.  My saying ‘let me go’ would not have meant to let me die, just ‘stop being so overbearing.  Let it go.  Let me do what I’m going to do. ’ It’s my life.  I’ll make my mistakes, but my mom has got to let me do that.","tokens":96},{"text":"Being diabetic and having somebody else try to control me has been such a large part of my life. ” Whatever his mother’s motivation, and no matter how much he has manipulated her into taking care of him, Jason’s salient experience is of a lack of autonomy.  He has had no capacity to assert himself openly.  His yearning for an autonomous self and his anger towards his mother have taken the form of resistance— including resistance toward his own physical health.","tokens":92},{"text":"“It was always like su ocation,” he told Heather.  “No matter what I did, it seemed to be wrong.  When I said ‘let go,’ it would have meant ‘just back o .  Let me live the way I’m going to live.  I’m going to live my way, and of course I’m going to make mistakes—everybody does.  I never felt free to make my own mistakes.","tokens":94},{"text":"” If there is one lesson to draw from the history of Jason and Heather, as from all the personal stories and all the studies we have considered in this book, it is that people su er when their boundaries are blurred.  By treating Jason all his life like a child for whom she must assume all responsibility, Heather has helped to hold him back from real person-hood.  By reacting like a child, Jason has held himself back.  In the nal analysis, disease itself is a boundary question.","tokens":97},{"text":"When we look at the research that predicts who is likely to become ill, we nd that the people at greatest risk are those who experienced the most severe boundary invasions before they were able to construct an autonomous sense of self.

There were over ninety- ve hundred adult participants in this research project.","tokens":82},{"text":"Childhood stressors such as emotional or sexual abuse, violence, drug use or mental illness in the family were correlated with adult risk behaviours, health outcomes and death.  There was a “strong graded relationship” between dysfunction in the family of origin and adult health status —that is, the greater the exposure to dysfunction had been in childhood, the worse the health status was in the adult and the greater were the chances of untimely death from cancer, heart disease, injury or other causes.","tokens":97},{"text":"9 Most commonly in the lives of children, boundaries are not so much violated as simply not constructed in the rst place.  Many parents cannot help their child develop boundaries because they themselves were never enabled to do so in their own formative years.  We can only do what we know.  Without a clear boundary between himself and his parent, the child remains enmeshed in the relationship.  That enmeshment is later a template for his way of connecting to the rest of the world.  Enmeshment—what Dr.","tokens":100},{"text":"Michael Kerr called a lack of di erentiation —comes to dominate one’s intimate relationships.  It can take two forms, withdrawal and sullen and self-defeating resistance to authority, like Jason’s, or chronic and compulsive caretaking of others, like Heather’s.  In some people the two may co-exist, depending on with whom they happen to be interacting at the moment.","tokens":83},{"text":"Since the immune confusion that leads to disease re ects a failure to distinguish self from non-self, healing has to involve establishing or reclaiming the boundaries of an autonomous self.  “Boundaries and autonomy are essential for health,” said the therapist and group leader Joann Peterson during our recent conversation on Gabriola Island.  She is director of education at PD Seminars, a holistic healing and psychological growth centre.  “We experience life through our bodies.","tokens":91},{"text":"If we are not able to articulate our life experience, our bodies speak what our minds and mouths cannot. ” “A personal boundary,” according to Dr.  Peterson, “is an energetic experience of myself or the other person.  I don’t want to use the word aura because it is a new-age kind of word, but beyond where skin ends we have an energetic expression.  We not only communicate boundaries verbally, but I think we have an energetic expression that is non-verbal.","tokens":99},{"text":"” In her book Anger, Boundaries, and Safety, Dr.  Peterson explains this concept in greater detail: “Boundaries are invisible, the result of a conscious, internal felt sense de ning who I am.  Asking yourself, ‘In my life and relationships, what do I desire, want more of, or less of, or what don’t I want, what are my stated limits?’ begins the process….","tokens":90},{"text":"In this self-de nition, we de ne what we value and want in life at this particular time from a place of internal self-reference; the locus of control is from inside ourselves. ” Autonomy, then, is the development of that internal centre of control.  5.  Attachment Attachment is our connection with the world.  In the earliest attachment relationships, we gain or lose the ability to stay open, self-nurturing and healthy.","tokens":90},{"text":"In those early attachment bonds, we learned to experience anger or to fear it and repress it.  There we developed our sense of autonomy or su ered its atrophy.  Connection is also vital to healing.

We think autonomy and freedom mean the liberty to do, to act or react as we wish.  Assertion in the sense of self-declaration is deeper than the limited autonomy of action.
